</div></div>
<p class='ti0'>We are the Dudley Grahams,—four children
and a mother. We are very poor
and keep a boarding-house; not because we like
boarders, but because when dear father died a
three thousand dollar life assurance and this
house were our only “available assets,” as Uncle
George, who was executor, explained: “and so
you must take boarders.” We do; but it isn’t
always pleasant.</p>
<p>The three thousand dollars did not last long,
either; for there were a great many debts to be
met that nobody had known anything about, and
we had to have the library repapered and a new
carpet in the hall, to impress the people who came
to look for rooms. “We must be very polite and
charming, too,” said Ernie, “and talk as hard as
we can all the time, and then perhaps they won’t
notice how shabby the rest of the things are.”
But I fancy they did; because it was over two
months before we could get anybody to stop with
us, and the money in the bank grew less and less,
while Uncle George grew more grim and disapproving,
and said that dear father had been
“criminally careless,” and that no man should be
permitted to have a family, if he did not know
enough to provide for it. But, at last, Miss
Brown came; and then Mrs. Hudson and the
Hancocks, and now we are really beginning to
get along.</p>
<p>Father was Uncle George’s only brother. He
was an inventor, and a true genius; but, unfortunately,
nobody ever discovered this, except
just us. He knew all about air-currents, the
contractile bladders of fish, and the flight of birds.
There is a great, ghostly, flying-machine in the
workshop in the attic with dusty yellow sails,
and a really wonderful motor. Haze, who sleeps
in the workshop since he was obliged to give up
his room to the boarders, often dreams that he is
taking trips at night. He says the dreams are
quite horrible, and calls them “nightmares”; but
if only dear father had lived to perfect the machine,
we are sure it would have been a success.
And that would have been so pleasant, for father
never had any successes, except just once,—which
we did not profit by, as I will tell later.</p>
<p>Haze is my chum. He is fifteen, and I am
seventeen; but sometimes we feel a hundred, because
there are so many things to worry about.
Dearest mother never worries. She is too Irish
for that;—all she cares for, she says, is that her
children shall be happy, and good, and clever, and
have everything they want. Somehow she seems
to believe that we are what she wishes us to be,
too,—so that one would feel ashamed to appear
discontented. But, oh, if you love your family
the way I do, it is hard, hard, hard to be poor!</p>
<p>However, to return to our <i>mutton</i>,—in this
instance Haze,—his real name is John Hazard,
though he is never called John or Jack, only Hazard,
or Haze, or Hazey, especially the last two,
because they fit so well. For, though he is very
clever and half through High School already, he
is not a bit practical, never sees what goes on
about him, and is always forgetting things. He
does not care about athletics, either. He hasn’t
the build, he says (his legs being too thin), nor
the time nor the money. He is in his Junior year
this term, the youngest in his class, and at present
he is cramming like mad, so that he can take the
final examinations next fall, and “begin to help
the family.” That means giving up college, his
fondest dream. It is mighty noble of Hazey;
but, I must confess, not at all becoming. His
face seems to grow smaller day by day, and his
eyes, behind his goggly glasses, bigger. Dear
Haze! he doesn’t even have time to talk to me
any more, and that is why I thought of starting a
diary. My cousin Meta has kept one for over a
year,—a dainty little volume with gold clasps and
a red morocco binding. This is just an ugly old
account book of father’s that I found in the workshop.
The first few pages are full of the most
amazing aërial computations; but there is plenty
of room left for writing,—and one must have
somebody to confide in!</p>
<p>After Hazard comes Ernestine. She is twelve,
and is frequently called Ernie,—which name
suits her just as well as Haze’s names do him;
for she is really more of a boy than a girl, we
think, despite her charming blue eyes and rose-leaf
complexion. Ernie is very, very pretty, has
sweet ways and a really lovely disposition; but,
for all this, she is rather a trying child, for she is
continually getting into scrapes, tearing her
frocks, breaking the furniture, etc.,—and she
always means so well that it is hard to scold
her.</p>
<p>Geof is Ernestine’s chum, just as Hazard is
mine. He is Uncle George’s son, but so much
more like a brother than a cousin that I am going
to describe him here. He is fourteen years old,
and the direct opposite of Haze in nearly every
way. He is a handsome fellow, big for his age,
and rather sullen sometimes. That, I think, is
because he is not happier at home. He goes to a
fashionable school, plays football and hockey,
and is perfectly hopeless in his studies. Uncle
George maintains he <i>could</i> do better if he would.
Aunt Adelaide, who is Geoffrey’s stepmother,
says it is a case of “inherent stupidity.” Mother
thinks neither is right, and that there is something
radically wrong with the school methods.
Altogether it is not pleasant for Geof, who wants
to give up studying and go into business. This
enrages Hazard.</p>
<p>“A fellow with <i>your</i> chances!” he says.</p>
<p>“I’d swap them for yours,” answers Geof, who
is not brilliant at an argument. And Haze snorts
derisively.</p>
<p>After Ernie comes Robin; he is six, and our
baby. He has never been strong, because when
he was a tiny mite of a thing a careless nurse
dropped him and injured his hip. He has bright,
dark eyes, and you can always tell when he is
coming by the little hopping sound he makes
with his crutch. It reminds one of a bird, so his
name suits him, too. I love Robin better than
anything in the world; and I am never going to
marry, so that I can stay with him and take care
of him always. But this is a secret.</p>
<p>And that (including mother, whom one can’t
describe because she is too wonderful) is all
there are of us, except the kitten, which is black
and is named Rosebud, and the cook, who is also
black and is named Rose. Of course, we did not
name the kitten after the cook. It just happened
that way.</p>
<p>As to Uncle George’s family,—whom we call
the George Grahams,—they are very wealthy,
and have a beautiful house, and horses, and plenty
of servants. But we would not change with
them. No, indeed!</p>
<p>When Uncle George comes to visit us of a
Sunday morning, as he sometimes does to see
how we are getting on, he is sure to stand in the
middle of our shabby back parlour, and puff out
his cheeks, and throw out his chest and say,—</p>
<p>“I don’t pretend to be a man of genius like
your father. I went into business at fifteen years
of age. I’ve pegged away a good forty years
since then, and I guess I’ve managed to get pretty
much what I want out of the world. Talent don’t
pay, sir. No, sir; it’s common sense that pays.”</p>
<p>Aunt Adelaide, who is Uncle George’s second
wife, is handsome and fashionable. She was a
widow with one daughter when Uncle George
married her. So you see that Meta is really no
relation to either Geof or ourselves. She is six
months older than I, and she and Geof do not get
along so very well. She thinks him stupid because
he does not like the things she likes, and he
thinks her silly and affected. I am afraid she
sometimes is.</p>
<p>Georgie is both Meta and Geof’s half-brother.
He is a little younger than our Robin. He has
very rosy cheeks, and beautiful clothes, and expensive
toys. Once when he was sick for two
weeks with German measles a trained nurse was
engaged, and he had chicken broth and oranges
every day. Sometimes I hate Georgie!—which
is wicked.</p>
<p>Uncle George is devoted to his family, after his
own fashion, and does not spare any expense
where they are concerned; though he, himself,
dresses plainly and never gives anything in
charity. He says he does not believe in it, that
no one ever gave anything to him.</p>
<p>One day when he was standing in the middle
of our parlour with his cheeks puffed out as usual,
Robin, who had been sitting in the window
turning the pages of an animal picture-book,
looked up.</p>
<p>“Did you ever wish you were a camel, Uncle
George?” he asked.</p>
<p>“No; I can’t say I ever did,” answered Uncle
George, condescendingly. “Why should I,
now?”</p>
<p>“It would be so much easier for you to get into
heaven,” chirped Robin. And, after a minute,
when Uncle George had thought it over and began
to understand, he laughed and really felt
rather flattered. Dear father was so different!</p>
<p>I said I would tell about his one success, and
how we did not profit by it as we should. It was
a great pity, because most of the problems father
worked on had no market value at all:—he was
too brilliant to find it easy to consider commercial
interests. But this was different,—something
quite sellable and practical,—a mechanical attachment
for dump-carts! How ever father came to
think of it, he admitted that he did not know.
He quite despised it, and was really rather
ashamed even to explain the way it worked. But
he made up his mind that for once a little money
would be nice; so he took the model to Uncle
George and asked for a loan. But Uncle
George’s own affairs were rather involved just at
that time, and besides he said he did not care for
investments of such a nature. He never had
much faith in father.</p>
<p>After that father was introduced to Mr. Perry,
a lawyer and promoter, and a partnership was arranged
between them by which father was to receive
$500 down, and in one year’s time five per
cent. of whatever income the invention continued
to realize. The contract was drawn up, for
father read it aloud to us one day at the lunch
table.</p>
<p>“I’ll go around to Perry’s this afternoon,” he
said, “and get this thing settled and off my
mind.” We were all quite excited, for it was a
long time since we had had anything to spend. I
remember we sat in the window-seat in the dining-room
and planned our winter clothes—Haze,
Ernie, and I—for nearly two hours.</p>
<p>However, we none of us saw father when he
came home. He went directly to his workshop,
and about ten minutes later, as Rose was passing
the door she thought she heard him call. So she
peeped in, and saw him standing supporting himself
with one hand on the table.</p>
<p>He tried to speak, but could only groan,
and the next instant he fell to the floor. Dear
father! it all seems like yesterday, now that I
write it. Rose gave the alarm. Somehow we
got him downstairs and into bed; but he did not
recognise any of us, and the next morning at
three o’clock he died.</p>
<p>Dr. Porter said the attack was brought on by
worry and brain fatigue. It seems so sad, just
on the eve of his first success! For nearly all
the carts one meets throughout the city nowadays
dump in father’s way, though the patent bears
Mr. Perry’s name.</p>
<p>And we never found the contract! Mr. Perry
says he knows nothing about it, and that he never
signed any. He has his brother as witness to a
verbal agreement entered into that same afternoon
in his office by which father sold the model
outright for five hundred dollars, which was paid
to him the same date by check.</p>
<p>It is true that Mr. Perry paid father. We
found the check in his waistcoat pocket; but it
was only on account, we feel sure. Without the
contract, however, we can prove nothing and are
quite helpless.</p>
<p>Could father have lost it, or left it anywhere
that afternoon? Even a little income would be
very nice,—for then perhaps we would not have
to take boarders.</p>
<p>There is Mrs. Hudson’s bell! She has rung
twice. Rose won’t answer it. I must fly!</p>
</div>
<div class='chapter' id='d1129'>
<div class='rb-container'><div class='rb'>
<h2 class='mt2em mb1em fs1r0em chapter'>Saturday, November 29.</h2>
</div></div>
<p class='ti0'>Blue! blue! blue! oh dear, I do feel blue, and
so does every one else, even the kitten! In
the first place the house is cold. We have not
been able to get the dining-room above 58° at any
time to-day, and the boarders appear to believe
that we keep it at that cosey temperature out of
pure spite and malevolence.</p>
<p>“My friend Mrs. <i>Bo</i>-gardus considers it a
stupid form of suicide to economise coal in <i>such</i>
weather,” Mrs. Hudson remarked this morning.
We had not been economising, but nevertheless
we felt crushed; for whenever Mrs. Hudson has
a criticism to make it comes under cover of the
same potent Name,—perhaps I don’t spell it quite
correctly, but <i>so</i> it is invariably pronounced.
None of us have ever met Mrs. <i>Bo</i>-gardus, none
of us ever expect to meet her,—she is a sort of
cousin to the famous “Mrs. Harris,” we are sometimes
tempted to believe,—but it is through her
reported remarks that we are given the coveted, if
immensely overestimated, advantage of “seeing
ourselves as others see us.”</p>
<p>This morning’s none too flattering vision resulted
in Haze being sent down to shake up the
furnace;—which did not prevent Miss Brown
from wearing her pink knitted shawl all day, and
sniffing, and rubbing the red tip of her nose. Just
why these artless actions should have enraged me
I don’t know; but, somehow, they did.</p>
<p>As Ernie once sagely remarked,—“However
innocent a boarder’s habits, they are bound to be
unpleasing.”</p>
<p>Then, too, I broke a string of my mandolin,
and I have not five cents in the world with which
to buy another. It is almost amusing to be as
poor as that. Also, Haze is growing cross as
well as homely, because it does not agree with
him to study late at night.</p>
<p>Last evening when I put on my golf-cape and
ran up to the workshop for a little chat I found
the poor boy sitting in the flying-machine with
his overcoat on,—it is <i>cold</i> in the workshop, let
me tell you,—pegging away at his Latin. He
looked up over his glasses and scowled
at me.</p>
<p>“Won’t it make you dream worse than ever to
sit there, dear?” I asked.</p>
<p>“The sails keep the draughts off,” answered
Hazard in sepulchral tones.</p>
<p>“What are you studying, Haze?” I ventured
next.</p>
<p>“My lessons,” came the communicative croak.</p>
<p>Nice, chummy conversation that! So I retired.</p>
<p>But I suppose I may as well be honest and admit
that none of the reasons I have mentioned yet
have anything to do with making me unhappy.
It is about Robin. We ought to take such good
care of him,—and we can’t! Thursday he
caught cold sitting on the draughty floor; and, as
usual, it settled in his little lame side. So mother
kept him in bed yesterday morning, and I amused
him with games and stories;—but after lunch he
grew feverish and tired.</p>
<p>“Would you like me to read again, Bobsie?” I
asked.</p>
<p>“No, thank you, honey,” he answered, and
turned his head wearily among the pillows.</p>
<p>“Would you like to play ‘Tommy-Come-Tickle-Me,’
or ‘Thumbs Up’?”</p>
<p>“No, dear, they aren’t a bit of good when your
legs ache. Sing, please.”</p>
<p>“What shall I sing?” I asked.</p>
<p>“About Heaven,” said Bobsie,—“like we did
last Sunday night.”</p>
<p>It wasn’t a bit priggish, the way he said it,—just
simple, and wistful, and very sweet.</p>
<p>So I took him in my arms in the big rocking-chair
and sang all the heaven hymns I know.
First, “There’s a Home for Little Children,” then
“Jerusalem the Golden,” and,</p>
<div class='cb-container'><div class='cb'>
<div>“I heard a sound of voices</div>
<div>  Around the great white throne,</div>
<div>With harpers harping on their harps</div>
<div>  To Him that sits thereon.”</div>
</div></div>
<p>When I came to that last beautiful verse,</p>
<div class='cb-container'><div class='cb'>
<div>“O Lamb of God Who reignest!</div>
<div>  Thou Bright and Morning Star,</div>
<div>Whose glory lightens that new earth</div>
<div>  Which now we see from far!</div>
<div>O worthy Judge eternal!</div>
<div>  When Thou dost bid us come,</div>
<div>Then open wide the gates of pearl,</div>
<div>  And call Thy servants home,”</div>
</div></div>
<p class='ti0'>the thought flashed through me, “What if God
should really take Robin from us,—him, too, as
well as father!” And I stopped singing, and
hugged him tight, and hurt his little, aching back!</p>
<p>“What’s the matter, Elizabeth?” asked Bobsie,
fretfully. “I was just going to sleep.”</p>
<p>“Nothing, honey,” I answered.</p>
<p>But that night after I had gone to bed the terror
returned, and I could not get any peace or
rest. I could not say my prayers right, either,
for it seemed as if heaven were full of harping,
and singing voices, and God would not hear. So
I tossed and turned, till finally I woke Ernie.</p>
<p>“What’s the matter, Elizabeth?” she asked,
just as Robin had.</p>
<p>“Oh, Ernie,” I answered. “I’m so unhappy!
I’ve been thinking that perhaps Bobsie is going
to die.”</p>
<p>“Well, of course we’re all going to some day,”
answered Ernie, sleepily. But she slipped her
hand into mine like a cuddlesome kitten, and
somehow I felt comforted.</p>
<p>Dr. Porter says that what Robin needs is “all
the luxuries.” That is, to go away in the summer
to the seashore or mountains, to have good
nourishing food, proper clothing, and plenty of
fresh air all the year round, and neither to be
overstimulated nor worried. Nice possible prescription,
<i>that</i>! Uncle George means to do what
is right, I am sure; but, oh, why can’t he say,—</p>
<p>“Here is $5,000. Take it, and make Robin
well.” If it were Georgie who was ill!</p>
<p>That reminds me that Geof was in this afternoon,
quite sulky and injured because he had to
go to the opera this evening.</p>
<p>“Meta has a friend staying with her,” he explained.
“And they prance round and see everything.
That’s all right; but why do they have to
lug me along?”</p>
<p>“Poor Geof,” purred Ernie, who is always
sympathetic. “What is it going to be?”</p>
<p>“Oh, I don’t know,” answered Geoffrey.
“They’re all the same. A fellow in pink pants
gets up and bellows at the top of his lungs,—‘<i>Ish
leap a dish!</i>’ The lady answers to the same tune,
only shriller, and then they both die. Giddy
show that!”</p>
<p>We could not help laughing; but how I wish I
were going in Geof’s place!</p>
<p>Mother would be sorry if she could see what I
have written to-day. I think she would call it
cowardly. She always faces things so bravely,
dear mother!—and if she can be cheerful and
light-hearted I am sure the rest of us should be.
I’ll try,—I will,—I will,—whatever comes!</p>

<h2 class='mt2em mb1em fs1r0em chapter'>Monday, December 1.</h2>
</div></div>
<p class='ti0'>Mrs. Hudson is going, and, oh dear! we
can’t afford it. It is all Ernie’s fault, too.
How could she have been so careless!</p>
<p>This is the way it happened. <i>We have had a
visit from Mrs. Bo-gardus!</i> No one would have
believed it possible; no one really, I suppose, except
Miss Brown and Robin, entirely believed
there was any “sich a person.” But to-day her
existence was proven to us. Let me begin at the
beginning and explain.</p>
<p>Mrs. Hudson has been with us six months now,
renting the second-story alcove room; and during
all that time, whether the beefsteak was tough or
the house cold, she has never personally complained.
It has been rather,—</p>
<p>“My friend Mrs. <i>Bo</i>-gardus simply couldn’t endure
such a draught as this. It would give her
pneumonia directly. She is a very sensitive
woman;—what I call a true blood aristocrat.”</p>
<p>“Is she indeed?” Miss Brown would murmur,
antiphonically responsive. Miss Brown is meek,
and meagre, and easily impressed.</p>
<p>“Yes,” Mrs. Hudson would continue, swelling
visibly under the arrested attention of the entire
dinner table (for everybody listens when Mrs.
Hudson talks):—“That is what I should certainly
call her. Now a soup such as we are eating
this evening simply wouldn’t <i>sit</i> on Mrs. <i>Bo</i>-gardus’s
stummick. It is too thick.”</p>
<p>“Her stummick is too thick?” queries Mr.
Hancock, anxiously. He is a dyspeptic, himself,
and very much interested in anything pertaining
to symptoms or dietetics.</p>
<p>“Not at all,” answers Mrs. Hudson, slightly
ruffled at the misapprehension. “The <i>soup</i> is
too thick.”</p>
<p>Whereupon Mr. Hancock, who has been eating
quite comfortably up to the present moment, takes
to stirring round and round his plate with reproachful
sweeps of the spoon, till his wife inquires
soothingly,—</p>
<p>“Don’t you think we might try some of that
Glucose Bread we saw advertised, Ducky? I’m
sure Mrs. Graham would get it for you.”</p>
<p>The Hancocks are young, and recently married.
He is a bank clerk with poppy eyes; she is
small, and plump, and pretty. They are “Ducky”
and “Dovie” to each other,—but they are really
nice and considerate, so one feels rather shabby
to poke fun.</p>
<p>However, to return to Mrs. <i>Bo</i>-gardus. It was
not only what she could not eat. She had a
great many opinions as well, especially as to how
people “in reduced circumstances” should live.</p>
<p>“Mrs. <i>Bo</i>-gardus thinks that if you can only
afford one servant you should certainly engage
<i>two</i>, for there is nothing that pays so well as
style.”</p>
<p>She also “thought” a great many other
things,—I can’t pause to relate them here,—and
no matter how patently absurd her opinions might
be, they were reported as such Delphic utterances
that no one dreamed of questioning them.</p>
<p>Every fortnight or so Mrs. Hudson has been in
the habit of paying Mrs. <i>Bo</i>-gardus a call. One
always learned at the breakfast table when one of
these visits was about to take place, for Mrs. Hudson
dressed for them upon rising, no matter what
time of day she may have planned to start, in a
purple velvet walking-suit, with white linen collar
and cuffs, and a very much crimped blond
false front. Her own hair is decidedly gray.
When she goes to church, or shopping with Miss
Brown, or even to the theatre, this answers. It
is only for Mrs. <i>Bo</i>-gardus the blond crimps
appear.</p>
<p>Naturally this morning when Mrs. Hudson
descended upon us “in full panoply of war-paint,”
as Haze expressed it, we supposed she must be
going to pay one of her ceremonial visits. Both
mother and I felt relieved, for the house continued
cold despite all our efforts; but we made
no remark, and Mrs. Hudson volunteered no information
till Rose appeared, rather untidy as to
dress and apron, bearing a plate of slightly
burned biscuits. Then it began.</p>
<p>“Mrs. <i>Bo</i>-gardus’s establishment consists of
three maids and an imported butler. His name is
Samuels,—with an <i>s</i>, if you please, Miss Brown.
One can judge from that fact alone of the style to
which she is accustomed.”</p>
<p>“Yes, indeed,” murmured Miss Brown.</p>
<p>“Now, anything like <i>this</i>,” continued Mrs.
Hudson, helping herself to a biscuit and weighing
it accusingly on extended palm, “simply wouldn’t
<i>sit</i> on Mrs. <i>Bo</i>-gardus’s stummick. She is used
to lunching at Sherry’s or the Waldorf, every
day, if she pleases. However, I have warned
her she must expect to find things different <i>here</i>.
She is fully prepared; for I explained everything
when I issued my invitation.”</p>
<p>“Mrs. <i>Bo</i>-gardus! <i>here</i>!” exclaimed mother,
setting down the cream jug with undue suddenness;
while Mr. Hancock, who had been morosely
weighing his biscuit in servile imitation of Mrs.
Hudson, dropped it into his coffee cup, and stared
with popping eyes.</p>
<p>“Yes,” returned Mrs. Hudson, evidently very
well satisfied with the impression she was producing.
“Haven’t I mentioned that I am expecting
a visit from Mrs. <i>Bo</i>-gardus to-day? She is
coming to lunch with me. It seemed about time
I should repay some of her hospitality. I hope
my little plan in no way inconveniences any one?”</p>
<p>Haze kicked me under the table. Ernie wriggled
ecstatically. Robin sighed, and opened
wide, shining eyes; while poor Miss Brown murmured
feebly,—</p>
<p>“Mrs. Hudson! Mrs. <i>Bo</i>-gardus! oh really!”</p>
<p>Mother was the first to regain her composure.</p>
<p>“We will be very glad to meet any friend of
yours, Mrs. Hudson,” she said; “but I am sorry
you did not tell me before. It would have been
easier to make arrangements.”</p>
<p>“Certainly, I intended to do so,” observed Mrs.
Hudson. “But the fact is, the matter slipped my
mind.”</p>
<p>We looked at one another in open admiration.
Could human cheek be carried further? Mrs.
<i>Bo</i>-gardus was coming to luncheon, and <i>the fact
had slipped Mrs. Hudson’s mind</i>!</p>
<p>Gradually the boarders faded from the room,
leaving us to a hurried family council. It was
Monday; there was cold roast left over from
yesterday’s dinner, and a washerwoman in the
kitchen. Yet, strangely enough, no one thought
of rebellion or complaint.</p>
<p>“Mrs. <i>Bo</i>-gardus,” murmured Haze, in a voice
as nearly like Miss Brown’s as he could make
it, “Mrs. <i>Bo</i>-gardus, you know, is coming to
lunch!”</p>
<p>And then, for no earthly assignable reason, we
dropped into various receptacles along the way
and melted and sobbed with mirth. Robin
caught his knees in both arms and rolled over and
over on the rug, a corner of the tablecloth
stuffed in his mouth. Ernie began to caper and
frisk madly about, hugging the bewildered and
rebellious kitten. I sank helpless on the window-seat,
and hid my face among the curtains.</p>
<p>“Shut the door, Hazard,” gasped mother, as
soon as she was able to articulate. “They
mustn’t <i>hear</i> us!”</p>
<p>At which the gale began afresh. Somehow
the situation struck us as irresistibly funny.</p>
<p>“Well,” chuckled Hazard, weakly at last,
“there’s no lark here for me. I shan’t meet her.
I’ll be away at school.”</p>
<p>“And I have a holiday to-day and to-morrow,
because they are repairing the furnaces! How
jolly!” cried Ernie.</p>
<p>“Will she come in a hansom?” piped Robin,
“or by fairy?”</p>
<p>He meant the ferry; and these two modes of
conveyance are the most elegant known to his
youthful experience.</p>
<div class='cb-container'><div class='cb'>
<div>“Yankee-doodle came to town,</div>
<div>Riding in a han-som!”—</div>
</div></div>
<p class='ti0'>parodied Haze.</p>
<p>“And driven by Samuels,—with an <i>s</i>, if you
please, Miss Brown,” mocked Ernie, wickedly.</p>
<p>“Children! children!” warned mother. “We
must be serious. It is Mrs. <i>Bo</i>-gardus, you
know;—and I had planned cold veal for luncheon!”</p>
<p>“Not even chicken?” pleaded Ernestine.</p>
<p>The situation as one faced it loomed portentous.
The psychic power of that Name was not
to be lightly evaded.</p>
<p>“Well,” said mother, at last, with a little sigh,
“we must do the best we can. Elizabeth will
help me in the kitchen, Rose is never the least
good of a Monday, and Ernestine can dress
Robin and superintend the setting of the table.
Let me see, there will be six, seven, of us,—eliminating
Haze and Mr. Hancock, who fortunately
do not lunch at home. I like an even table
so much better.”</p>
<p>“Let me wait then, mother dear,” volunteered
Ernie. “The way I do Sunday evenings when
Rose is out. You know she never does serve
things properly.”</p>
<p>“You would not mind?” asked mother.</p>
<p>“No, indeed; not a bit,” answered Ernie,
frankly. “Everybody will know I am your
daughter, just the same, and I think it is rather
fun.”</p>
<p>So it was arranged. The <i>menu</i> took a little
longer to plan; and with cooking, dusting, and
dressing, the morning flew swiftly by. One
might have supposed we were preparing for a
royal visit.</p>
<p>Eleven o’clock struck,—half-past eleven.
Robin and Ernie in their pretty blue sailor-suits
flashed down to the kitchen for inspection.</p>
<p>“Will she be here soon?” pranced Robin. His
eyes were bright as stars, his cheeks as pink as
roses.</p>
<p>“I think so,” answered mother. “Run up to
the nursery now, where you can watch from the
window.”</p>
<p>At quarter to twelve precisely there sounded
the clatter of horses’ feet upon the asphalt. Shall
I confess it? Interrupting a hasty toilet I ran to
the window, too, and peeped out like any child.</p>
<p>A hansom-cab, as Robin had predicted, was
drawn up before our door. From it stepped a
middle-aged lady. She was tall, somewhat
spare, attired in conventional black. From the
distance at which I surveyed her she looked a
little, just a <i>little</i>, like—<i>Miss Brown</i>! She
mounted the steps and rang the bell.</p>
<p>The excitement died from my brain. A chill
feeling of disappointment crept over me. Was
this the phœnix? this the invisible mentor under
whose <i>dicta</i> our household had trembled for so
many months? A minute later the sound of
subdued greeting floated up from the hall
below.</p>
<p>“How do you do, Mrs. Hudson?”</p>
<p>“How do <i>you</i> do, Mrs. <i>Bo</i>-gardus?”</p>
<p>I went into the nursery to capture Robin and
give his locks one final dab before lunch should
be announced.</p>
<p>“She’s just like anybody else,” he mourned,
lifting a tear-stained face from where it had been
buried in his arm against the window sill.</p>
<p>“Well, dearest, what did you expect?” I asked,
with an absurd inflection of sympathetic woe.</p>
<p>“I don’t know,” admitted Bobsie, “but,
somehow, I thought—she would be <i>different</i>.”</p>
<p>Then the bell rang, and we hastened downstairs.</p>
<p>In the dining-room the presentations were
being made.</p>
<p>“Mrs. Graham, allow me the Honour of Presenting
my friend Mrs. <i>Bo</i>-gardus; Mrs. <i>Bo</i>-gardus,
Mrs. Graham.—— Miss Brown, allow
me to Present my friend Mrs. <i>Bo</i>-gardus; Mrs.
<i>Bo</i>-gardus, Miss Brown.—— Mrs. Hancock, allow
me the Honour of Presenting my friend Mrs.
<i>Bo</i>-gardus; etc.——”</p>
<p>Immediately our spirits rose. It was an Occasion,
after all. Mrs. Hudson felt it, I felt it,
Robin felt it. He put out his little hand quite
prettily when his turn came.</p>
<p>“So this is the lame boy?” remarked Mrs. <i>Bo</i>-gardus,
in a stiff falsetto.</p>
<p>“No,” protested Robin (I don’t think he had
ever been called lame, before), “I just hop a little,
because sometimes my side aches.”</p>
<p>“It is the same thing, my dear,” explained Mrs.
Hudson. “Mrs. <i>Bo</i>-gardus knows all about such
matters. She sits on two hospitals boards, and
is Secretary of the Free Kindergarten Association.”</p>
<p>“Indeed!” murmured Miss Brown.</p>
<p>With Mrs. Hudson as expositor, and Miss
Brown as chorus, Mrs. <i>Bo</i>-gardus’s glory could
not wane. She shone upon us, enigmatic, sphinx-like,
throughout a somewhat oppressive meal.
No one but Mrs. Hudson ventured to mingle in
the conversation. Indeed, it was not necessary.
Ernie waited very prettily; the croquettes were
silently engulfed, likewise the custards. And,
despite Mrs. <i>Bo</i>-gardus’s sensitive “stummick,”
we were encouraged to believe that they would <i>sit</i>.</p>
<p>“My dear, will you play for us?” Mrs. Hudson
asked after lunch. “Mrs. <i>Bo</i>-gardus is very fond
of music.” It was rather a royal command than
a request, but without an <i>e</i> string what could one
do?</p>
<p>“Then perhaps your little brother will recite?”
persisted Mrs. Hudson.</p>
<p>“What shall I say, Elizabeth?” asked Robin,
obligingly.</p>
<p>“Suppose you say ‘My Shadow,’” I suggested.</p>
<p>So Bobsie, flushed and honoured, standing on
the worn Bokhara rug, began:—</p>
<div class='cb-container'><div class='cb'>
<div>“I have a little shadow that goes in and out with me,</div>
<div>And what can be the use of him is more than I can see.”</div>
</div></div>
<p>The ladies sat about the parlour, their hands
folded in their laps, Mrs. <i>Bo</i>-gardus with her head
a little to one side as if listening for a false
note, Mrs. Hudson pompously responsible, Miss
Brown meekly appreciative.</p>
<div class='cb-container'><div class='cb'>
<div>“The funniest thing about him is the way he likes to grow,—</div>
<div>Not at all like proper children, which is always rather slow,”</div>
</div></div>
<p class='ti0'>piped Robin in his pretty treble.</p>
<div class='cb-container'><div class='cb'>
<div>“For he sometimes shoots up taller,——”</div>
</div></div>
<p>Mrs. <i>Bo</i>-gardus’s head tilted just a little to the left.</p>
<p>“Shoots?” queried Mrs. Hudson. “Are you sure of that word <i>Shoots</i>?”</p>
<p>Robin paused, and looked doubtfully at me.</p>
<p>“Yes,” I answered. “Shoots is right.”</p>
<div class='cb-container'><div class='cb'>
<div>“—like an india-rubber ball,”</div>
</div></div>
<p class='ti0'>continued Robin.</p>
<p>Mrs. <i>Bo</i>-gardus’s head again cocked towards
the left, and a slightly pained expression gathered
between her brows.</p>
<p>“Isn’t it <i>plant</i>, my dear?” corrected Mrs. Hudson.
“Since the first word is <i>shoots</i> it certainly
must be an india-rubber <i>plant</i>?”</p>
<p>“No,” I said, “ball is right.”</p>
<div class='cb-container'><div class='cb'>
<div>“And he sometimes gets so little that there’s none of him at all,”</div>
</div></div>
<p class='ti0'>persisted Robin, bravely.</p>
<p>Mrs. <i>Bo</i>-gardus pursed her lips.</p>
<p>“Well, well,” concluded Mrs. Hudson, hurriedly.
“This is a very pretty piece, no doubt,
and we are much obliged; but Mrs. <i>Bo</i>-gardus
can’t sit here all the afternoon listening to one
little boy recite, when she might hear twenty any
day she pleased, all with kindergarten training,
too! There are some photographs we have
planned to look over upstairs, so <i>if</i> you will excuse
us——” And the two ladies, rising with
majestic accord, swept from the room.</p>
<p>It was rather dampening, to be sure, but Bobsie
bore it well. Only his lower lip trembled a little
as he asked,—</p>
<p>“It couldn’t have been a rubber-plant, now
could it, Ellie?” That is his pet name for me.
He uses it when he stands in need of comfort.</p>
<p>“No, honey,” I answered. “It certainly
couldn’t.”</p>
<p>When just at that moment there was a crash,
and a hurtle, and a smothered squeal in the hall
outside, and we all ran out to see what could be
happening.</p>
<p>I shall never forget it. Down the stairway
from the second story, step after step, with a little
bump on each, coasted Ernie. Her feet were
stuck out straight before her, her arms were aloft,
in one hand she bore a pitcher of ice-water, in
the other a tumbler, while mother’s old silver
serving tray rattled and rolled ahead. The poor
child’s mouth was open, and every few steps she
would emit a deprecating little squeak, as if to
say:—</p>
<p>“<i>I know I ought not to be tumbling downstairs.
But what are you going to do about it?</i>”</p>
<p>Mrs. Hudson and Mrs. <i>Bo</i>-gardus, who had
started to go up in search of the photographs,
stood midway of the flight, directly in the path of
danger.</p>
<p>“Ernie! Oh, Ernie!” I cried. “Look out!
Look <i>out</i> for <i>Mrs. Bo-gardus</i>!”</p>
<p>“I c-c-c-can’t!” gurgled Ernie. “Let her
g-get——”</p>
<p>And then there was a second crash, and a
splash, and a renewed series of squeals, and Mrs.
Hudson, and Mrs. <i>Bo</i>-gardus, and Ernie, and the
pitcher, and the silver tray, all came crashing and
bumping down together in one ignominious
tangle.</p>
<p>Mother, and Mrs. Hancock, and Rose came
running from various parts of the house. In a
moment there was quite a crowd gathered.</p>
<p>First Mrs. Hudson was picked up, spluttering
and bewildered; next we rescued Mrs. <i>Bo</i>-gardus;
then Ernie, who still clung desperately to her half-empty
pitcher. All dignity, all sense of social
circumstance, had vanished. The members of
the dripping little group glared upon one another,
humanly, democratically mad.</p>
<p>“Here,” said Ernestine, thrusting out the
pitcher resentfully to Mrs. Hudson, “I guess this
belongs to you.”</p>
<p>“<i>This</i>” was the ceremonial blond front, which
had somehow come unpinned in the mêlée, and
was now floating mermaid-wise in a few inches
of ice-water at the bottom of the pitcher.</p>
<p>Mrs. Hudson sniffed, fished out her crimps,
and flapped them scornfully.</p>
<p>“I leave this house to-morrow,” she remarked.
“Children are all very well in their
<i>place</i>!”</p>
<p>“It wasn’t my <i>place</i>,” contradicted Ernie,
wrathfully. “I slipped on the top step and tobogganed!”</p>
<p>“Ernestine!” rebuked mother. “I trust you
are not hurt,” she continued, turning to Mrs. <i>Bo</i>-gardus,
who stood beside the newel-post, ruefully
rubbing an elbow.</p>
<p>“Not being a Christian Scientist, nor yet a
gutta-percha image, I confess to a few bruises,”
returned that lady, spitefully; after which she
and Mrs. Hudson swept on their way upstairs,
leaving us at gaze.</p>
<p>“As if I meant to,” brooded Ernestine. “I’m
not a Christian Scientist, myself. Why couldn’t
they get out of the way, I’d like to know? and—<i>who’s
Mrs. Bogardus, anyhow</i>?”</p>
<p>For the first time the question was presented to
us squarely. We gaped at one another, like so
many goldfish.</p>
<p>“That is so,” admitted Miss Brown in a timid
voice, after a moment of deep thought. “Who
is she?”</p>
<p>“And it couldn’t have been a rubber-plant,”
chirped Bobsie with sudden easy confidence, “because
then there wouldn’t be any rhyme.”</p>
<p>“It was a hired hansom she came in,” observed
Mrs. Hancock, cheerfully. “And did you notice
that she ate three of those fried croquettes for
lunch? Her stummick can’t be so very
sensitive, after all! I shall have to tell my
husband!”</p>
<p>Certainly, Ernestine’s pitcher of ice-water had
had a wonderfully quenching effect! But Mrs.
Hudson is going, and, as I said, we can’t
afford it.</p>
<p>“I was only trying to help,” murmurs Ernie,
mournfully pulling off one of her long stockings,
as she sits on the floor in the middle of our little
room. “Do stop writing, Elizabeth, and come to
bed. There is a smudge of ink on the tip of
your nose where you dipped it in the bottle, and
I just know you are saying it is <i>all my fault</i>!”</p>
<p>Dear little Ernie, how did she ever guess?</p>
</div>
<div class='chapter' id='d1202'>
<div class='rb-container'><div class='rb'>
<h2 class='mt2em mb1em fs1r0em chapter'>Tuesday, December 2.</h2>
</div></div>
<p class='ti0'>Mrs. Hudson left this afternoon, despite
the fact that Ernie apologised to her very
meekly this morning.</p>
<p>“Do you really think I ought, mother?” Ernie
asked.</p>
<p>“Yes, dear; I do,” mother answered. “She
was frightened and hurt and we are all sorry.”</p>
<p>Ernie made a wry face. “Perhaps she’ll stay,
if she knows I did not mean it,” she said.</p>
<p>“No,” answered mother. “I am sure that she
will not. It is not for that reason that I want you
to apologise. Apart from the financial inconvenience
I can’t regret Mrs. Hudson’s decision.
In some ways it will be a great relief.”</p>
<p>“Well, here goes,” announced Ernestine.
“The little Christian martyr bids a last bye-bye
to her fond family.” And she turned and ran
from the room.</p>
<p>She found Mrs. Hudson packing.</p>
<p>“You know I did not mean to tumble downstairs,
Mrs. Hudson,” she told me later that she
said:—“and I’m sorry that I had the pitcher with
me. I was taking it up to your room for Mrs.
<i>Bo</i>-gardus.”</p>
<p>“You seemed to be coming <i>down</i> the stairs
when we met you,” returned Mrs. Hudson, suspiciously.</p>
<p>“Yes,” confessed Ernie. “I know it. I had
brought up only one glass. I was going back for
another, and my foot tripped.”</p>
<p>“Well,” returned Mrs. Hudson, evidently quite
unmollified, “we will say no more about it. For
a long time I have felt that a change would be
desirable. Yesterday’s incident simply confirmed
me in my half-formed resolution. I am going
from here to stop with a Friend for a day or two,
till I can look around and get more comfortably
settled.”</p>
<p>“I hope you will have a good time, I’m sure,”
observed Ernie, forgivingly. “But I wouldn’t
want to visit her.”</p>
<p>Mrs. Hudson stared. “<i>You?</i>” she queried.
“Oh, my dear!”</p>
<p>And directly after lunch she left us, and Ernie
started in on a wild hunt for “the dump-cart
contract.” To look for the contract is Ernie’s
last resource in times of trouble.</p>
<p>“It must be somewhere, Elizabeth,” she argues,
“and why not about the house? We know
perfectly well that father went especially to get
it signed that afternoon. He wouldn’t have
come away without it. Perhaps it’s poked in a
bureau-drawer, or under the blotting-paper on
his desk, or maybe even back of the cuckoo-clock!”</p>
<p>And so, though these very places have been
ransacked again and again, Ernie proceeded to
turn the workshop upside down;—covered herself
with dust crawling under Hazard’s cot,
skinned the tip of her nose on the gas-fixture, and
tore a great rent in her pink flannel petticoat.</p>
<p>About three o’clock Geof dropped in, as he
generally does on his way home from school, and
joined in the chase.</p>
<p>“Do you mean to say you have really lost a
Boarder?” he asked, summing the catastrophe
with a worried look. “You can’t afford it, can
you?”</p>
<p>“No,” answered Ernie, mournfully, “we can’t.
I just wish mother would whip me, as I deserve.
It’s awful to love your family, Geof, and be nothing
to them but a misfortune. Perhaps, if we
don’t let Mrs. Hudson’s room soon, we won’t be
able to afford ice cream on Sundays, and Mr.
Hancock likes ice cream better than anything in
the world. <i>They</i> will be leaving next.”</p>
<p>“Oh, cheer up,” said Geoffrey. “You’re not
a misfortune to anybody, Ernie. If only Uncle
Dudley had finished this,”—the three of us were
standing rather disconsolately about the flying-machine,—“you
wouldn’t have to think of
boarders, or dump-carts, or anything like that.
You’d be rich, and famous, too. Did he ever
make an ascension, do you know?”</p>
<p>“Once, late at night, he tried,” answered
Ernestine. “But I don’t think it was a success.
He only rose a few feet from the roof, and then
got tangled in some of the neighbours’ clothes-lines.
Come on, Geof. Let’s look once more in
the cuckoo-clock. It stands at the foot of the
stairs, you know. Father might have stopped to
wind it, and slipped the agreement into the works
by mistake. It buzzed fearfully the last time we
tried to make it go,—as if it were suffering from
some sort of impediment.”</p>
<p>Entertaining no personal hope in regard to the
cuckoo-clock, I left them on the landing and ran
down to the dining-room, where I found Haze,
who had also just come in. He was standing in
the window, looking ruefully over the gas bill,
which the postman had handed him through the
grating.</p>
<p>“So Mrs. Hudson has really gone?” he began,
throwing off his overcoat. “Well, as far as I
can see, that means just one thing.”</p>
<p>“What does it mean, Haze?” I asked, surprised
at his tone.</p>
<p>“That I give up High School,” answered Hazard
gloomily, and cast his books and cap together
upon a chair.</p>
<p>“Oh, Hazey!” I protested. “Wouldn’t that
be rash? We may let Mrs. Hudson’s room to-morrow.”</p>
<p>“We may,” returned Hazard, “but we
won’t.”</p>
<p>Then he seated himself astride the chair, his
arms folded across the back, his chin resting upon
his arms.</p>
<p>“It’s this way, Elizabeth,” he began. “I’m the
man of the family, and I mustn’t shirk my
responsibilities.”</p>
<p>“But you aren’t shirking, Hazard,” I urged,
settling myself in the window-seat opposite him.
“You are working, and working hard, to finish
your education. It would be a dreadful thing
for you to give up now,—it would mean a handicap
for years, perhaps for life.”</p>
<p>“Some fellows have got to accept a handicap,”
answered Hazard. “And the very fact that they
know it spurs them on,—so that in the end, perhaps,
it isn’t a bad thing. I’ve been doing a lot
of thinking lately; but I couldn’t make up my
mind and so I wouldn’t talk, not even to you, old
girl. But this is how it stands. I can’t bear to
see mother struggling along with the house, and
Robin, and all her worries,—trying to satisfy
everybody, being snubbed sometimes, and—unappreciated.
At first, I thought I’d give up college
(you know, I’d intended going in for the
Conklin Scholarship, and every one said I would
win it, too), but even so there would be two more
years of study, and I’m not sure I could keep up
the pace I’ve set myself lately. Then, I had a talk
with Merriweather the other day” (Dr. Merriweather
is the principal of Hazard’s school),
“which wasn’t altogether satisfactory. He
doesn’t think a fellow gets any good cramming
the way I’ve been doing, and he intimated that
even if I took the examinations next fall, and
passed ’em, he wasn’t at all sure that he would
graduate me. Well, that pretty nearly settled
the business, and now this affair at home drives
in the last nail. I’m going to quit, and take my
proper place as the head of the family.”</p>
<p>“But, Hazard,” I urged, “don’t you think you
ought to consult mother, or some older person,
first? It’s a very grave step for you to take on
your own responsibility. And besides, I don’t
believe mother will <i>let</i> you be the head of the
family. And who would employ you? and what
sort of position could you fill?”</p>
<p>“That depends upon the acumen of the man to
whom I apply,” returned Hazey, with such an
owly look through his big glasses that I really
wanted to laugh. “You know, Elizabeth, how
Uncle George is continually repeating that
though he doesn’t care for talent in his business
he is willing to pay for ‘brains.’ I’ve got ’em,
and I’m going to rent them to him! It’s a sacrifice,
but I’ve made up my mind, so there’s no use
arguing.”</p>
<p>“But you’ll wait till the end of the week, any
way, dear,” I pleaded. “Give us that long, at
least, to rent the room.”</p>
<p>“Yes; I’ll wait till Saturday,” compromised
Hazard. “We shall have finished the Punic
Wars by that time, and I’ve written a rather stunning
outline on the subject I should like to have
criticised. But if the room isn’t rented by then I
quit. Now, remember, Elizabeth, not a word of
this to anybody,—especially Ernestine. I don’t
want her to feel that she is in any way responsible
for blighting my career.”</p>
<p>“I won’t tell,” I answered; and so, of course, I
haven’t; but, oh, I am very much afraid that
Hazard is making a mistake!</p>

<h2 class='mt2em mb1em fs1r0em chapter'>Wednesday, December 3.</h2>
</div></div>
<p class='ti0'>We advertised Mrs. Hudson’s room to-day.
It cost a dollar. Ernie wanted to say
that we are a refined Christian family with a good
table, but mother would not hear of it;—which
was lucky, considering the price! When the advertisement
was finally ready, Haze and I took it
around to the newspaper office;—and the long
shining shafts cast by the electric-lights on the
wet asphalt (it had been raining) made us feel
quite frisky. I would rather be a mediæval
knight than a girl whose mother keeps a
boarding-house,—but, as Haze observed, there are diversions
in every lot.</p>
</div>
<div class='chapter' id='d1205'>
<div class='rb-container'><div class='rb'>
<h2 class='mt2em mb1em fs1r0em chapter'>Friday, December 5.</h2>
</div></div>
<p class='ti0'>This morning we had a call from Aunt
Adelaide. She came “to advise” us, because
she had heard about Mrs. Hudson. Aunt
Adelaide does not call very often; but when she
does, she makes the best of her time. To-day
she had Georgie with her,—so charmingly
dressed! He wore a dear little fur-lined overcoat,
and a cap with snug ear-laps, and a jaunty
cockade. How I wanted them for Robin!—who
took cold yesterday when Ernie had him out on
her sled. It was the first snowstorm of the
season, and Bobs did so beg to go; but to-day he
is in bed again, suffering with rheumatism in his
back. Dear, patient, little lamb!</p>
<p>“So much sickness is most unfortunate,” reproved
Aunt Adelaide. “Can’t you subordinate
the children a little more, Margaret? How can
you expect people to stop in a house where there
is continual invalidism?”</p>
<p>“I don’t expect it,” returned mother, cheerfully.
“It is a perpetual surprise to me that anybody
<i>should</i> stay.”</p>
<p>Aunt Adelaide stiffened. “Have you considered
the consequences if they did not?” she
asked.</p>
<p>“Yes,” admitted mother. “We should starve,
I suppose,—since man does not live by advice
alone.”</p>
<p>“George was really very much put out when he
heard that you had lost Mrs. Hudson,” continued
Aunt Adelaide. “It is most discouraging. You
were beginning to get along quite nicely;—and a
man who has so many heavy responsibilities
naturally feels each extra burden.”</p>
<p>“Of course,” agreed mother. “It must be
very trying to have poor relations, I am sure.”</p>
<p>Here Georgie interrupted. “You said I should
visit with Bobsie, mamma,” he cried. “I want
to go up now, and tell him about my new rocking-horse.
It’s stupid down here.”</p>
<p>“Elizabeth will take you, love,” answered his
mother, apparently without the least thought of
“subordination.” So I took Georgie by the hand
and led him up to the nursery.</p>
<p>When I returned to the library the conversation
had been switched:</p>
<p>“Positively, he grows worse and worse,” Aunt
Adelaide was saying as I entered the room.
“Yesterday he was openly impertinent to me, and
flatly refused to accompany Meta to dancing-school.
I do not wish to bring the affair to his
father, who is rather severe at times, but I declare
there is no managing the boy. He won’t
study, he has no manners, and he resents interference
in any direction.”</p>
<p>It was Geoffrey, of course—and I felt sorry.
So did mother. The mocking note had quite
died from her voice, as she answered simply and
kindly,—</p>
<p>“I think you are a little unjust, Adelaide.
Geoffrey requires tactful handling, I know. He
is apt to be sullen at times; he is not bookish; but
in his own way, along the mechanical line, it
seems to me that he is really clever.”</p>
<p>Aunt Adelaide sighed. “Heaven forbid his
being an inventor! One is misfortune enough
for any family.”</p>
<p>Mother merely smiled that little quiet smile of
hers, and asked how Meta was progressing with
her music. She will never discuss father with
either Aunt Adelaide or Uncle George;—but the
attack was not to be so easily repelled, and Aunt
Adelaide returned to it a moment later by asking
bluntly if there had been any further news of Mr.
Perry, and whether we had given up all hope of
finding the contract.</p>
<p>“George says the whole affair is entirely typical
of poor Dudley,” she declared. “He has not
an ounce of patience with it.”</p>
<p>And then, after a few further generalities,
Aunt Adelaide prepared to leave, quite unconscious
that she had said anything to wound or
offend any one, and I was sent upstairs to fetch
Georgie.</p>
<p>I knew that there was trouble as soon as I
opened the nursery door. For Bobs in his little
old flannel dressing-gown was sitting up very
straight and white-lipped in mother’s big bed pretending
to look at a picture-book; while Georgie,
with red face and hands thrust deep in his
knickerbocker-pockets, was standing by the window,
pretending to look out.</p>
<p>“I’ll tell you something more you don’t know,”
said Robin, glancing up from his book after a
moment’s silence. They had neither of them seen
me enter the room. “Shall I?”</p>
<p>“I know more’n you do!” chanted Georgie,
monotonously.</p>
<p>“You don’t know what a Chimera is; and you
don’t know what a Gorgon is; and you don’t
know what a Hippogrif is; and you don’t know
what a Ninkum is! You wouldn’t if you saw
one! And you don’t know what a Siren is; and
you don’t know what Syrian is, now neither!
Do you?”</p>
<p>George seemed rather overpowered by this
erudite outburst; but he reiterated stubbornly:—“I
know more’n you do!”</p>
<p>“What’s a Very Imp?” asked Bobs, excitedly.
“You don’t know! And what’s a Jabberwock?
and what’s a Mockturtle?”</p>
<p>“You eat it in soup,” answered Georgie,
brightening up a bit. “We had it the night the
General came, and William let me taste some out
of a teaspoon in the butler’s pantry,—so there!”</p>
<p>“<i>Nonsense!</i>” Bobs’ scorn was withering.
“Maybe you’d eat a Ninkum in fish-cakes! <i>We</i>
don’t! A Mockturtle was once a real turtle,
and——”</p>
<p>But here I thought it best to interfere. “Aunt
Adelaide is going, Georgie,” I said. “You had
better come downstairs, now.”</p>
<p>As soon as Georgie saw me he put his finger
in his mouth and began to cry and asked to be
taken down to mamma, for Bobsie was rude to
him and said he didn’t know things.</p>
<p>“That certainly is not very polite,—to company!”
I answered for Robin’s best good; and
took Georgie by the hand and led him away.
But just as we reached the foot of the stairs we
heard the unrepentant Robin sing out triumphantly,—</p>
<p>“I’ll tell you some more things you don’t
know, too. You don’t know what a Crusader
is, nor a Centaur, nor you don’t know
<i>nothing</i>!”</p>
<p>Georgie was quite overcome by this last taunt.
He clenched his fist savagely. “I just guess I
do know sompfin’,” he sobbed. “I’m going to
ask mamma if I don’t.” And he broke away
from me, and ran into the parlour.</p>
<p>Of course, Aunt Adelaide soothed him, and assured
him that he knew a great deal for a little
boy of his age, but that he must be patient with
his little sick cousin.</p>
<p>So Georgie stopped crying and looked virtuous;
while Aunt Adelaide explained to mother
that she knew just how it was in regard to Robin,
and thought it only natural that he should be
pettish and quarrelsome, and that she would bring
Georgie soon again to cheer him up! After
which our visitors departed in quite a pleasant
glow of self-satisfaction; and mother went downstairs
to the kitchen,—very mad,—to superintend
the preparation of luncheon; and I ran up to the
nursery,—very mad,—to try and soothe Robin’s
ruffled spirits.</p>
<p>Nor did it take me long to learn the cause of
the disagreement,—for Bobsie was only too eager
to confide. It seems that among his other new
possessions Georgie has a nursery governess who
is teaching him to read, and though Robin did not
mind about the pony, and never once thought of
envying the fur-lined overcoat and cap, he could
not bear to be told that Georgie knew more than
he did! The idea is really ridiculous to any one
who knows the two children; but, on the whole,
it had been an excellent thing for Master Robin
to face, for now he is determined to learn to read,
too,—a proposition we could never get him to
entertain before, as he always said “he perferred
to lie still and listen.” I am to give him lessons
each morning, and if he sets his mind to it, I am
sure he will get on rapidly.</p>
<p>Just think! dearest Haze walked home from
school this afternoon,—though it is over three
miles,—and bought a string for my mandolin
with his car fare. Not many brothers would
think of a thing like that.</p>

<h2 class='mt2em mb1em fs1r0em chapter'>Sunday, December 7.</h2>
</div></div>
<p class='ti0'>Mrs. Hudson’s room is not yet rented.
We have not even had any answers to
our advertisement. The strain is beginning to
tell on us all more or less, I think; and yesterday
morning Hazard carried out his intention of calling
at Uncle George’s office and applying for a
position. I wish he hadn’t. Mother agrees with
me that it was a mistake. Indeed, she was quite
shocked and hurt at what she considered his lack
of confidence in her. She told him very gravely
that he had no right to take a step of so much
consequence without her consent, and that the little
he can make will in no way compensate for the
loss of his education. Poor Hazey! he was so
disappointed. He had expected the news would
be received very differently. He did not say
much, but thrust his hands deep into his trouser
pockets, threw back his head, and strolled whistling
from the room. I followed up to the workshop
as soon as I was able, and I <i>think</i> he had
been crying.</p>
<p>“Well, tell me about your position, Haze,” I
began, in as sprightly tones as I could muster;
for we had not heard any of the details
yet.</p>
<p>“There’s nothing to tell,” answered Hazard,
gruffly. “I’m to run errands, post letters, and
that sort of thing, at three dollars a week.”</p>
<p>“Oh, Hazey!” I gasped, for it was a shock.
Hazard is certainly clever, and we had always
expected such different things for him.</p>
<p>“Yes,” says Haze, bitterly. “It’s Uncle
George’s idea, and I <i>suppose</i> he knows what he
is about. I gave him every opportunity, and put
the matter to him squarely. There was no use in
false modesty; so I told him, first thing, that I
had had a year of Greek, and two years of Latin,
and led my geometry class; but that we needed
money at home, and so I had determined to
sacrifice my future, and rent my brains at their
highest market value.”</p>
<p>“Did you really say all that?” I asked.</p>
<p>“Yes, I did,” answered Hazard, a little defiantly.
“Perhaps it was a mistake, but I wanted
to make things plain. Uncle George didn’t answer
just at first. He looked me up and down
in that way he has, and then he said,—‘Young
fellow, you’ve got a lot to learn yet. If any other
cockerel came crowing to me in my office, I’d
show him the door. Understand one thing. I
haven’t any use for <i>talent</i> in my business’ (though
I had been most particular, Elizabeth, to use the
word <i>brains</i>). ‘Can you remember what’s told
you? Can you sweep out a room, and not forget
the corners? Can you jump when sent on errands?
Then apply to Mr. Bridges in the outside
office. I believe we’re losing a boy to-day.
Perhaps you are bright enough to fill his place,—though
you don’t look it.’</p>
<p>“Well, I applied, and got the position,” concluded
Haze, “and that’s all there is to it.”</p>
<p>There did not seem much for me to say, since
Haze was not in a mood to be grateful for platitudes.
Uncle George was certainly severe, but
maybe he meant it for a lesson; and from something
that happened this afternoon I am tempted
to think it was not entirely wasted.</p>
<p>We were all gathered in the workshop after
dinner, Geoffrey, Ernie, and myself, wrapped in
golf-cloaks and overcoats, disputing about our
favourite apostles, when Haze, who had been
rather subdued and “broodful” the greater part
of the day, entered the room. He had a notebook
under his arm.</p>
<p>“Going to study, Hazey?” I asked him, for he
intends to keep up his Latin, and mother has
promised to help.</p>
<p>“No,” he answered, with really appalling
solemnity. “I have written my first Poem.”</p>
<p>“Your first What?” roars Geof.</p>
<p>“Poem,” admitted Haze, blushing a bit.</p>
<p>“My hat!” murmurs Geof. “This is so
sudden! But go on, old chap. Let’s have it,—don’t
mind me.”</p>
<p>“If you treat the matter with respect,” says
Haze, suddenly on his dignity, “I’ll read it to you.
Otherwise I won’t.”</p>
<p>“Fire ahead,” urged Geoffrey, who was simply
on the <i>qui vive</i> to hear. “We’re as respectful as
you please. We’ll listen, and then criticise.”</p>
<p>“No larks, mind,” warned Hazard. “According
to my own ideas this is the real stuff.”</p>
<p>And, as we settled ourselves to attention in the
flying-machine, he began, in what I can only call
an “uplifted” sort of voice,—</p>
<div class='c'>
<div class='mb1em'>THE YOUNG MAN AND THE WORLD.</div>
</div>
<div class='cb-container'><div class='cb'>
<div>The young man faces the stern, cold world,—</div>
<div>“Oyster!” he says, “O oyster!——”</div>
</div></div>
<p>There was an hysterical gurgle from Geof, and
a fierce “Keep quiet, can’t you!” from Ernestine.</p>
<p>“I’ve told you,” says Hazard, interrupting
himself to look severely over his glasses, “that it
is perfectly indifferent to me whether you hear
this thing or not. I don’t care a hang for your
literary opinions,—and I’ll not be guyed about it.”</p>
<p>“Go on,” pleaded Geoffrey, with a watery,
sidelong look at me. “Who’s guying you?”</p>
<p>So Haze began afresh,—</p>
<div class='c'>
<div class='mb1em'>THE YOUNG MAN AND THE WORLD.</div>
</div>
<div class='cb-container'><div class='cb'>
<div>The young man faces the stern, cold world,—</div>
<div>“Oyster!” he says, “O oyster!</div>
<div>Open thy shell, and show me thy pearl,</div>
<div>Like the hidden wealth of a cloister.”</div>
<div class='mt1em'>The cold world answers never a word.</div>
<div>The youth is bound, if he can,</div>
<div>To take up his pickaxe and work for himself,</div>
<div>Till he prove that he <i>is</i> a man!</div>
</div></div>
<p>“Ho! ho!” exploded Geof, unable to restrain
himself a moment longer. “Pickaxe is good!
That’s the way to get after ’em! Bully for you,
old boy!”</p>
<p>“What do you think, Elizabeth?” says Hazard,
haughtily ignoring this demonstration, and
turning somewhat coldly to me.</p>
<p>“I’m not sure that you could say hidden wealth
of a ‘cloister,’” I answered. “Somehow it
doesn’t sound exactly historical.”</p>
<p>“<i>‘Oyster!’ he says, ‘O oyster!’</i>” murmured
Geof.</p>
<p>Whereat Ernie, who had controlled herself
beautifully up to that moment, gave vent to one
enthusiastic whoop, and disappeared backward
into the flying-machine.</p>
<p>“I see,” says Hazey, with really magnificent
aplomb, “that I have made a mistake. You are
not in the proper mood to appreciate the thing.
But whatever other criticisms you may make, at
least you’ll be bound to admit that it Sums the
Situation.” With which remark he stalked from
the room.</p>
<p>Dear, precious fellow! Evidently he has
been thinking,—but, why, oh why, will he always
take himself so seriously?</p>
</div>
<div class='chapter' id='d1208'>
<div class='rb-container'><div class='rb'>
<h2 class='mt2em mb1em fs1r0em chapter'>Monday, December 8.</h2>
</div></div>
<p class='ti0'>This afternoon mother let Robin up in the
big wicker rocking-chair in the nursery
window. He was so glad, poor darling;—for he
has spent the last three days in bed.</p>
<p>The street was full of snow; and the boys were
having a fine time with their shovels, their sleds,
and a small black-and-tan terrier which pranced
here and there, yapping excitedly. Two of the
taller fellows were busy making a path in front
of their house; a little chap with glowing cheeks
and a red cap had improvised a slide on the half-cleared
pavement; while others were engaged in
a brisk snowball fight.</p>
<p>Bobsie, pale but delighted, watched everything
with eager approbation.</p>
<p>“That’s the smartest dog!” he cried. “His
name is Buster. Come and see, Elizabeth. If
he thinks they’re going to hit him with a snowball,
he’ll run away,—but, if he thinks they’re
going to hit somebody else, he’ll just stand and
bark and wag his tail. You can’t fool Buster!”</p>
<p>“How do you know his name?” I asked.</p>
<p>“Pooh!” boasted Bobs, “that’s easy;—for a
person who looks out of windows as much as me.
I know all the boys’ names, too, and where they
live, and whether they have sisters. I pertend
that they are my friends, and that I’m out there
playing with them. You can hardly tell the difference,
sometimes! We have such fun.”</p>
<p>“I’m glad you do, darling,” I answered.
“Which game do you like best to play?”</p>
<p>“Oh, that depends on the time of year,” answered
Robin, judicially. “I’ve watched, until I
know all about it. In summer there is Cat and
Prisoner’s Base; when fall comes we have football
in the corner lot, and some of us wear noseguards;
then there’s snowballing and sliding all
winter; and in the spring, marbles, again. Only,
John an’ me don’t play for keeps, because our
mothers wouldn’t like it.”</p>
<p>“Which is John?” I asked.</p>
<p>“He’s the little one with the red cap, who’s
sliding,” answered Robin. “I like him best, because
he is such a kind boy. Why, one day, Ellie,
when my legs ached so I couldn’t pertend to go
out, even for a few minutes, John was the only
one who missed me! The others kept right on
playing:—but he stopped all of a sudden, and
looked up at the window, and smiled. So now
I’ve taken him for my chum:—wouldn’t you?”</p>
<p>“Yes, honey,” I answered. “I think he must
be a very nice little boy.”</p>
<p>“He is,” agreed Robin, proudly. “The day
we broke the baker’s window, an’ the cop chased
us, John ran faster than anybody. Of course, it
was easy for me. All I had to do was to pertend
to dodge in here and slam the door <i>quick</i>!...
But watch! we’re going to give Buster a ride,
now. Isn’t that fun?”</p>
<p>The black-and-tan terrier seemed to think it
was. He kept his place well in the middle of the
sled, tail up, tongue lolling, while two of the boys
seized the rope and, followed by the others, made
madly off,—the gay cavalcade disappearing
noisily around the corner.</p>
<p>Robin dropped back among his pillows with a
disappointed little sigh.</p>
<p>“I’m sorry they’ve gone so soon,” he said;
“because, you see, I can’t pertend to play, ’cepting
only on this block.” Then he laid his cheek up
against my arm. “Sometimes those little boys
must be sick, too, mustn’t they?” he asked. “And
I guess it’s pretty hard then, for they aren’t used
to it like me. There’s a lot in being used to a
thing, isn’t there, Ellie dear?”</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<p>Oh, if we could only feel that Robin was growing
stronger! I pray for it every night, and so
do mother, and Haze, and Ernie, I know;—and
we “pertend” to think that he is, and tell each
other that it is because of the cold weather he
feels wretched so much of the time:—but, in our
secret hearts—— Well, the doctor has ordered a
new kind of cod-liver oil. It is very nasty, and
costs eighty-five cents a bottle. Perhaps it will
do Robin good!</p>

<p class='ti0'>Ernie has distinguished herself again.
How can she be so naughty, and <i>never</i> mean
any harm! This time Geoffrey is implicated,
too, but I can only do justice to the affair by constructing
it from the beginning, piecing together
the details as we learned them in yesterday evening’s
soul-thrilling confessional.</p>
<p>It seems that the two children were bitterly
disappointed a week ago Tuesday when they
searched the cuckoo-clock for the lost contract,
and found nothing more exciting than a deserted
mouse’s nest.</p>
<p>“I call it a giddy sell,” remarked Ernie, so
near to tears that Geof was honestly concerned.
“No matter how good you try to be, nor how
much you try to help, everything turns against
you.”</p>
<p>“Oh, cheer up,” said Geoffrey. Ernie never
looks more bewitching than when her blue eyes
swim behind a veil of suspended woe. “What’s
the good of worrying, Bunnie?”</p>
<p>“I guess you’d worry,” returned Ernie, dolefully,
“if Georgie were sick, and your family were
poor, and you were responsible for making them
more so! It’s all very well to say ‘cheer up,’
Geoffrey Graham, and I’m sure I do most of the
time, but this afternoon I want to do something
<i>really useful</i>.”</p>
<p>“Well then, see here,” says Geof, a bright idea
striking him all of a sudden. “I’ve got a plan.
Come up to the workshop again, where we won’t
be interrupted, and I’ll tell you.”</p>
<p>“Is it something in which I can help?” asked
Ernie, doubtfully.</p>
<p>“It’s a pretty big undertaking,” answered Geof,
closing the workshop door mysteriously. “I
don’t believe a girl has ever been concerned in
such an affair before;—but, see here, why
shouldn’t you and I together <i>perfect Uncle Dudley’s
flying-machine</i>?”</p>
<p>“Geoffrey!” cried Ernie, with sparkling eyes.
“Could we? truly, do you think?”</p>
<p>“I don’t see why we shouldn’t,” answered
Geof, seriously. “I’ve thought a lot about the
matter, without supposing I’d ever have the
chance to put it to the test. I’ve taken the motor
out, and examined it. It is certainly a stunner;
and the steering apparatus seems simple enough.
You say Uncle Dudley really made one ascension?”</p>
<p>“Not exactly,” qualified Ernie. “The machine
didn’t rise any distance at all. Father was dreadfully
disappointed. But later he cheered up and
said there was just one little detail that stood between
him and ‘a complete solution of the
problem of aërial navigation.’ I remember his
very words, and how excited we all were.”</p>
<p>“That is what I have always understood,” answered Geof.
“Uncle would have perfected the
thing if he had lived long enough. It’s magnificent
to contemplate,—and a beastly shame to
think of the fruits of his genius lying up here
rusting in a totally unknown attic! Why can’t
you and I take the matter up where he left it, find
out the root of the trouble,—just one little detail,
you say,—and let Mr. Perry and his old dump-carts
go hang?” It isn’t often that Geof waxes
eloquent. When he does he is worth listening to.</p>
<p>“We can! we can!” jubilated Ernie, clapping
her hands. “Oh, Geof, it’s a splendid scheme!
Why has no one thought of it before?”</p>
<p>“I have thought of it, often,” answered Geoffrey;
“but somehow, up to to-day, it seemed impossible.
What you’ve just told me throws an
entirely new light on the matter, and I think we
are justified at least in trying.”</p>
<p>“And if we don’t succeed,” says Ernie, “nobody
need know anything about it.”</p>
<p>“That’s so,” answered Geof. “We’ll have to
do a lot of hard studying and thinking, and we’ll
keep the thing a deadly secret;—but I tell you, if
we do make it go, <i>it will be worth while</i>!”</p>
<p>And so the conspirators set to work. For a
week they ransacked father’s library, reading up
on aëronautics generally, studying every pamphlet
and authority they could lay their hands on.
There was one thing that especially confused
them. Each man supported a “totally different
theory,” as Ernie plaintively complained. It was
extremely trying, especially as dear father had
worked almost entirely in his head, leaving very
few directions or specifications to guide them to
the right trail. At last Geof declared that he
thought they would never get anywhere through
books; that their one hope lay in practical experiment.
Ernie quite agreed with him, and after
that they spent hours in the airship, mastering
as they supposed the intricate details of motor,
steering apparatus, and machinery. Geoffrey
even discovered what he considered a slight error
in the automatic system of shifting weights.
Finally, last Saturday morning, behind closed
doors, the motor was taken out and started up.
It ran like a dream. They came to the bold conclusion
that nothing remained to hinder an experimental
ascension!</p>

  <div class='caption fs90p'>
    And so the conspirators set to work
  </div>
</div>
<p>All this time it must be understood mother and
I had not the faintest suspicion as to what was
going on. We knew that there was “a secret” in
the workshop, “a beautiful surprise for the
family.” Just how great a surprise, however, we
neither of us dreamed.</p>
<p>Yesterday afternoon was the time set for the
ascension. How the two children managed alone
to raise the heavy machine from the workshop
floor to the roof by means of the trap-door and
pulleys father had used in the previous experiment
will always remain a mystery. But they did! At
last it stood among the chimney-pots, with rakish
sails and scarred sides, looking for all the world
like “a tipsy eagle-bird,” as Ernie enthusiastically
declared. Even by this time neither of
the little idiots seems to have had the least realisation
of <i>what</i> it was they were attempting. On
the contrary, they were quite wild with the frolic
and excitement of the thing.</p>
<p>Geof straightened out the sails, and opened the
manœuvre valve. <i>Tick-tock</i>, sounded the motor.
The framework quivered response.</p>
<p>“Hold on there,” shouted Geoffrey, as he ran
to attach the short length of anchor line to a hook
in the stone coping at the front of the roof.
“Don’t get in yet, Ernie. The place in the middle
belongs to me. I’ve got to manage the steering
gear.”</p>
<p>“All right,” Ernie answered, climbing over the
side, nevertheless. “I’m just looking to see which
of these levers starts her.”</p>
<p>And then,—no one will ever know how it
happened, Geoffrey had his back turned, Ernie
can’t explain,—there was a whiz, a whirr, deep in
the interior regions of the old airship, a sudden
tug on the mooring-line that sent Geof sprawling
into the tin gutter, and with a swoop, entirely unprecedented,
I believe, in the whole history of
aërial ascensions, the apparatus had risen, perhaps
some twenty feet! The voyage was begun.
Ernie, alone in the flying-machine, circled and
jibed above the chimney-pots!</p>
<p>Geof, regaining his feet, made one desperate
grab for the safety-line. It slipped through his
fingers, and swung to the left,—just out of reach
beyond the stone coping.</p>
<p>“<i>Aunt Peggy! Aunt Peggy!</i>” he then bawled
with such a panic of woe in his voice that mother,
who had been sewing on Ernie’s new school-dress
in the nursery while I read aloud to her and
Robin from <i>Tanglewood Tales</i>, dropped her
work to the floor and fled up the attic stairs.</p>
<p>I followed at top speed. Geof’s face, thrust
on a long neck through the trap-door in the roof,
stared whitely down upon us. His eyes and
mouth were wide. He looked for all the world
like a terror-stricken gargoyle.</p>
<p>“Ernie!” he gasped. “She got away from me.
<i>She’s flying!</i>”</p>
<p>“Geoffrey!” says mother, stern as any Spartan,
“are you mad?”</p>
<p>“No! no!” protested Geof. “Put your head
out the window. You’ll see her! I tried to
hold her down, but——”</p>
<p>“The flying-machine!” I cried, with one distraught,
comprehensive look about the dismantled
workshop.</p>
<p>At that moment a clamour rose to us from the
street below.</p>
<p>“Have yez got er license?” bawled an infuriated
Irish voice. “Come down out ov thot.
I arr-rest yez!”</p>
<p>“It’s only a kid girl,” sang a shrill chorus of
gamins. “I seen her petticoats!”</p>
<p>In another instant mother and I were on the
roof, straining over the stone coping. Some
fifteen feet below us, about on a level with the
nursery window now, sailed Ernie. She sat quite
rigid in the car, which laboured and beat a curiously
straight course between the two rows of
houses directly down the middle of the street.
We could hear the <i>tick-tock</i> of the motor and the
excited comments of the crowd.</p>
<p>“Ernie!” I cried. “Oh, Ernie!”</p>
<p>Ernie’s pallid countenance was raised to us.</p>
<p>“<i>Good-bye, mother dear!</i>” she wailed in plaintive
crescendo. “<i>Give my pinky ring to Mary
Hobart, and——</i>”</p>
<p>Mother turned. For a moment I thought she
was going to jump off the roof. But instead she
sped, Geof and I at her heels,—it wasn’t running,
it wasn’t flying,—down the ladder through the
workshop, down two flights of stairs to the second
story, where, throwing up a window, she reached
out in a vain attempt to grasp the short length of
dangling anchor-line. But already it was too
late. The car and the crowd had passed by.</p>
<p>“This is terrible!” we gasped, and fled for the
street.</p>
<p>Here high comedy reigned rampant, if any one
had been in a mood to appreciate the fact. Two
policemen, one stout and red-faced, the other tall
and thin, beat down the block, their eyes aloft,
bawling impossible directions. A butcher’s boy,
followed by a gang of enthusiastic street urchins,
had clambered to the roof of his cart, and moving
slowly along directly beneath the labouring machine,
rose ever and again in a series of ungainly
but agile leaps, clutching hopefully at the surrounding
atmosphere. In the area-ways, and
gathered on the neighbouring stoops, were groups
of excited people. Rose, escaped from the
kitchen, had climbed the hydrant in front of our
house, where, supported by Mrs. Hancock, she
maintained a perilous equilibrium, the while
she waved a red cotton lunch cloth and bellowed,—</p>
<p>“<i>Whar yer boun’ fer, Miss Ernie? Fer de
Law’s sake tell us whar yer boun’ fer?</i>”</p>
<p>While Miss Brown, her head wrapped in her
pink knitted shawl, ran back and forth, clucking
like a distraught hen.</p>
<p>“Is she any relation to you, mum?” the red-faced
policeman demanded of mother, jerking
his thumb severely skyward as he spoke.</p>
<p>“My daughter,” came the distracted response.</p>
<p>“Then call her down,” commanded the minion
of the law. “Oi can’t have such goin’s-on on my
beat!”</p>
<p>“She doesn’t know how to manage the machine,”
mother said. “At any moment it may
fall with her. What is to be done?”</p>
<p>“Hi, Bill! ring in an al-lar-rum,—fer the hook-an’-ladder
comp’ny, and an amberlance!” shouted
the policeman to his mate at the corner.</p>
<p>At the same moment the airship, as if instinct
with demoniacal life, ceased for an appreciable
instant its laboured progress, began to nose the air
uncertainly, and then in a short series of jerky
swoops rose, again and again, to an altitude of
some hundred feet or so. There it poised,
came about in its sweep, rose once more, and
finally began to settle with steadily increasing
velocity.</p>
<p>We stood spellbound. One could literally
hear the breathing of the crowd. The suspense
was too horrible. Ernie—our darling Ernie!
Could nothing be done to save her?</p>
<p>“’Ware below there!” shouted the taller of the
two policemen.</p>
<p>And just then the bow of the ship grazed the
roof of the corner house past which it was dropping.
There sounded a familiar <i>tick-tock</i>. The
machine started off in a new direction, bumping
along the house-fronts, till finally with a shock of
tearing wood and a crash of splintered glass it
succeeded in bunting its way half through a
second-story window, midway of the block.
Where it lodged!</p>
<p>A distinct gasp of relief escaped from the
crowd,—followed by a feebly started cheer,
which rose and swelled in volume as with
clang of bell and clatter of flying hoofs
the hook-and-ladder company swung round
the corner of the street and bore down
upon us.</p>
<p>The next few moments passed for me in a
confused sort of dream. When I finally came to
myself I found that I was sitting on the lowest
step leading up to the house in the window of
which the airship was lodged. Miss Brown sat
beside me, firmly clasping her own hand, the
while she murmured,—</p>
<p>“We mustn’t faint, my love. We mustn’t!
If your dear mother can stand the strain, everybody
else should <i>gladly</i>!”</p>
<p>The firemen and policemen were gathered in
an official group in the gutter, and around them
sported and pranced a delighted bunch of street-boys.
Mother had disappeared.</p>
<p>In another moment the house door opened, and
a whitecapped maid came down the stairs to say
to me,—</p>
<p>“Your mamma wishes you to go home to your
little brother now, miss. The young lady is quite
safe inside. They will follow when the crowd
has gone. My! what a fright we’ve had. That
there flying-airship-machine not only broke the
window, but tore out the sash! I thought it was
Judgment Day.”</p>
<p>Well, somehow I managed to get home,
where I clasped trembling little Robin in my
arms.</p>
<p>“What has happened, Ellie?” he sobbed.</p>
<p>“Ernie went flying, honey,” I answered, and
looked at the clock. The whole incident had
passed in exactly thirteen minutes! If I had not
the evidence of my own eyes I should never believe
it.</p>
<p>Finally the excitement subsided. The crowd
gradually dispersed. Ernie, in a quelled and
chastened frame of mind, her hand clasped tight
in mother’s, returned.</p>
<p>They brought sad news of the flying-machine.
It seems that while the policemen and hook-and-ladder
crew still stood discussing the best method
of bringing it down,—perhaps some three minutes
after my departure from the scene,—the
motor again started up, the car took a last fatal
leap backward, and fell two stories to the street,—where
it was shattered into so much kindling
wood. Which goes to show just how much we
have to be thankful for!</p>
<p>“Oh dear!” grieved Ernie, plaintively. “Who
could have suspected our surprise would turn out
so! Where’s Geoffrey? Has anybody seen
him?”</p>
<p>It appeared upon investigation that Geof had
been to the basement-door to inquire “if all were
well within.” He was very white and wild-looking,
Rose said, and seemed ashamed to come in.</p>
<p>I should have liked it better if he had come and
faced mother on the spot; but instead he sneaked
off home,—Geof is certainly a queer fellow in
some ways,—and that evening confessed the
whole affair to Uncle George, asking for money
to pay whatever damages we are responsible for,
and legal protection for himself and Ernie. For
he imagined that they were in some way publicly
liable, and might be arrested at any moment.</p>
<p>Uncle George was very angry, the more so
since any display of inventive activity on Geoffrey’s
part is extremely distasteful to him. He
called upon mother this morning to acquire
further details, and remarked with a flourish of
his cane that he had “thrashed Geof soundly.”</p>
<p>Uncle George is always primitive, and generally
mother disapproves of his methods; but this
time she returned, with a flash of her maternal
eye, that “it was just what Geoffrey needed.”
Nevertheless, she herself believes in what might
be called “reformatory” punishments. So Ernie
took her dinner in bed last night, where she would
have plenty of time to think, while <i>we</i> answered
the questions of the boarders, and Haze interviewed
quite a string of enterprising reporters on
her behalf! He really managed rather well, I
fancy, and finally convinced them that there was
not much of a “story.”</p>
<p>The matter, however, did not end there for
Ernie; for this afternoon when she came home
from school mother called her into the nursery,
and pointing to the pretty plaid dress on which
she had been working when the excitement began,
remarked,—</p>
<p>“My dear, since you are so anxious to be helpful
I shall let you finish your dress yourself. The
material is cut, and the lining basted. I will give
whatever directions you may need, but dressmaking
is not nearly so difficult an art as the construction
of flying-machines. Besides, if you are
busy with your needle, I shall not worry about
you.”</p>
<p>Poor Ernie! her face was a study. She simply
hates sewing. “It makes her toes prick,” she
says. Also, it will mean giving up all her playtime
for weeks to come, and she must be careful
and not botch, since she will have to wear the
result of her labours.</p>
<p>On the whole, I think her punishment was even
more severe than Geoffrey’s. But neither of
the culprits complains. Rather they <i>glide</i> about
the house in such a beatific state of Christian
humility that one knows it cannot last.</p>
<p>“I don’t believe in hitting a fellow when he’s
down,” remarked Haze to me this evening. “But
I’m glad they realise what they’ve done. Apart
from the frightful publicity of the thing, I <i>miss
the flying-machine</i>. There is nothing to keep the
draughts off my head at night, and the workshop
is not what it was!”</p>
</div>
<div class='chapter' id='d1211'>
<div class='rb-container'><div class='rb'>
<h2 class='mt2em mb1em fs1r0em chapter'>Thursday, December 11.</h2>
</div></div>
<p class='ti0'>This afternoon mother called on Mrs. Burroughs.
She is the lady whose house Ernie
broke into with the flying-machine, and I forgot
to say how lovely she was about it. “Surprised,
of course,” as Ernie admitted, “but <i>so</i> pleasant.”</p>
<p>Mother intended calling yesterday, to arrange
about the broken glass, etc.,—for which, fortunately,
Uncle George said he would pay,—but she
was flat, poor dear, with a nervous headache, and
so had to put it off. Ernie was rather shaken,
too, and Robin quite excited and feverish.</p>
<p>As he continued to have a little “temperature”
this morning, I did not give him his reading lesson
till afternoon. He is really getting on very
nicely, when one considers the disadvantages
against which he has to fight;—not only his ill
health, but he has had so many stories read to
him, and is so far advanced for his age in other
ways, that it is hard for him to read:—“I see a
Cat. Does the Cat see me?” If he did not wish
to crush Georgie’s rising conceit, I think we
would have a struggle teaching him.</p>
<p>He said to me to-day when the lesson was over,—“Oh,
Ellie, I do hate cats,—all but Rosebud!”
and sighed prodigiously. It is amusing to hear
Robin sigh. He is such a little boy, and the sigh
is so very big. I told him he would make an invaluable
passenger aboard a sailing vessel, for,
if the wind died down, it would only be necessary
for him to sigh once or twice to blow the
ship right into port.</p>
<p>This idea tickled him mightily, and he sighed
again even louder than before, and then he said he
would tell me a story. I love Bobsie’s stories,—they
are so original. Here is the one he told this
afternoon:</p>
<p>“Once there was a Crusader, and his name was
Max, and he lived up a tree in the Holy Land.”</p>
<p>“What sort of a tree, Robin?” I asked.</p>
<p>“It was a nut-tree,” Bobs replied, “and there
were chestnuts on it, and hickory-nuts, and peanuts,
too. The Crusader and the squirrels what
lived with him used to eat them all day long. But
one time the squirrels had gone out on a visit, and
the Crusader was sitting on a branch alone, and
he saw a Griffin go by. And the Griffin was
muttering and murmuring to his self, ‘Oh, you
wait, my fine lady, till I get home, and then won’t
I have you for my tea! Oh! ho! my fine madam,
just you wait, and then we’ll see!’ So Max, he
knew right away that that meant a Princess; and
he slid down the trunk of the tree, an’ he ran right
up to him, an’ he shouted in his ear,—</p>
<p>“‘<i>Where’s</i> that Princess you have hid?’</p>
<p>“And the Griffin jumped, but then he pertended
it was only a burr what he had in his foot,
and he said,—</p>
<p>“‘Princess? Princess? I haven’t any Princess,
my dear fellow. What are you talkin’
about?’</p>
<p>“And just then Max he heard a sobbing
sound, which was the Princess weeping, and he
shouted,—</p>
<p>“‘Oh my! not much you haven’t! I hear her
crying this very instant, an’ if you don’t tell me
where she is, I shall cut your head slam bang
off!’</p>
<p>“But the Griffin he was v-e-r-y clever, and he
said, ‘What do you mean, old nosey? Why, that’s
only my sick grandmother that you hear. She
has an influenza, and so she’s <i>got</i> to sniff!’</p>
<p>“But the Crusader was not so easily fooled as
all that, and he took up his sword, an’ he cut off
the Griffin’s head! bang!! And then he looked
around for the Princess, an’ after a while he found
her in a pit what the Griffin had dug. And then
the Crusader, and the Princess, and the squirrels
all went and lived in the Griffin’s castle, ’cause
the Princess didn’t know how to climb trees, and
anyhow Max was tired of nuts.”</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<p>Just as Bobsie finished his story mother came
in from her call, and as we wanted to hear all
about it, she took him in her lap in the big rocker,
while I seated myself on the hassock at her feet.
Mrs. Burroughs, she said, was charming,—so
cordial and friendly, and would not listen to anything
about “damages.” She seemed endlessly
amused at Ernie’s escapade, and laughed and
laughed over it. Then she would break off to
apologise, and say she fully realised how great
the shock must have been to us;—till some freshly
funny aspect of the adventure would strike her,
she would laugh again, and mother would laugh,
too.</p>
<p>Finally they began to talk of other things.
It seems that Mrs. Burroughs had had a little boy
who was an invalid. His name was Francis. He
was ill for five years with some spinal trouble, and
died when he was seven. Mother told me the
sadder details later, for Robin takes his illness
so much as a matter of course that we never like
to say anything before him that would be apt to
make him realise, or arouse apprehensions. Mrs.
Burroughs’ husband had died some years previous,
and so she was left quite alone, except for
an aunt, an old lady of nearly seventy, who fortunately
was out making calls Tuesday afternoon,
and so escaped the excitement of Ernie’s invasion.</p>
<p>Mrs. Burroughs then asked mother a number
of questions about Robin. She said she had often
noticed his little pale face at the nursery window
as she passed our house, and she wondered if he
ever got out. Mother answered that we could
not let him go very often this winter, for he took
cold so easily, and his crutches seemed to tire him.</p>
<p>Then Mrs. Burroughs flushed a beautiful rose
colour, hesitated, and said, in a breathless little
way, that her boy, Francis, had had a wheel-chair
for the last couple of years of his illness from
which he had gotten a great deal of comfort and
pleasure. She had often wondered, seeing Robin
at the window, if it would not be nice for him,
too. Half a dozen times, she said, she had been
on the point of sending it over.</p>
<p>“And it shall come to him this evening. I
don’t know what has held me back so long! You
will let your dear little son accept it as a gift from
my Francis, will you not, Mrs. Graham?” she
pleaded. “Children have no feeling about taking
presents from one another,—and I should be so
very, very glad. For Francis always loved to
give!”</p>
<p>Of course, mother could make but one answer,—and
how splendid the chair will be for Robin!
Now he can get out on the mild, sunny days,
which was impossible for him when he was dependent
only on Ernie’s sled. Dear little fellow!—he is
delighted with the prospect, and we have
great hopes of the good it will do him.</p>
<p>And how kind of Mrs. Burroughs to think of
it, and offer it the way she did,—without any
hint of patronage or condescension. She also
asked with what mother called “a hungry look”
if she might not run in sometime and make Bobsie’s
acquaintance, and she invited Ernie and
me to call upon her, too. I shall love to go, and
even Ernie admits that perhaps it won’t be so bad,
since Mrs. Burroughs seems to be “a delicate sort
of person” who understands how “others feel.”</p>
<p>Really it is rather pathetic the way Ernie has
brightened up since we have had the offer of the
chair. I think in her secret heart she considers
herself responsible;—a sort of unappreciated
<i>dea ex machina</i>, as it were. And certainly it is
an unlooked for and lovely end to what might
have proven a very terrible adventure.</p>
</div>
<div class='chapter' id='d1213'>
<div class='rb-container'><div class='rb'>
<h2 class='mt2em mb1em fs1r0em chapter'>Saturday, December 13.</h2>
</div></div>
<p class='ti0'>The sun shone bright and beautiful this
morning, there was no wind, and the
streets were clear of snow, so Bobsie went for a
ride in his new wheel-chair. What do you think
he wore? The dearest little fur-lined overcoat,
and a fur cap with a military cockade, almost the
exact duplicate of those belonging to Georgie
which I was mean enough to envy the last time
he came to see us!</p>
<p>This is the way it happened. The wheel-chair
did not come from Mrs. Burroughs Thursday
evening as we had hoped. Robin kept watching
for it, and listening for the bell. I waited, too,
but all in vain. I don’t know which of us went
to bed the more disappointed. The next day,
Friday, it rained. Robin could not have gone out
under any circumstances,—but it was not until
late in the afternoon, after hours of waiting, that
the chair finally arrived.</p>
<p>It was left at the basement door by Mrs. Burroughs’
maid with a big bundle and a little note.
Mother read the note, while I undid the bundle,
cutting all the strings, you may be sure, and wondering
what it might contain. Inside the wrapping
paper there was a dear little steamer rug;—such
a pretty, serviceable plaid, and warm as
warm can be. Then came the overcoat, the fur
cap with close ear-laps, just such as they are
wearing this winter, and a charming pair of fur-lined
gloves! But,—could we accept so much?</p>
<p>“Listen, Bobs,” said mother, and read the note
aloud:</p>
<div class='blockq'>
<p class='ti0'><span class='sc'>“My Dear Robin:—</span></p>
<p>“The wheel-chair which I am sending, and the coat and
cap, belonged to a little boy whom I wish you might have
known and loved. His name was Francis. If you had
known him, you could not have helped loving him, I am
sure. He was sick a great deal of the time, like you, and
always so patient and good. Your mother tells me that you
are good, too, and that is why I want you to have his
things. I had to alter the coat and cap a little, or you
would have had them before this, for my Francis always
liked his clothes just so,—in the very latest style. Perhaps
you feel that way, too! Please wear them,—and I hope
you will enjoy the chair very much. It will make me happier
to know that another little boy is making use of my
boy’s things.</p>
<p>“With love to your mother and yourself, believe me,</p>
<div class='rb-container'><div class='rb'>
<div>“Your friend,</div>
<div><span class='sc'>Clara Cecilia Burroughs.”</span></div>
</div></div>
</div>
<p>Now was not that a lovely note?</p>
<p>“Will you take the things, Bobsie dear?” said
mother.</p>
<p>“’Course I will,” answered Bobs with a sympathetic
sniff. He had felt the sadness underlying
the gentle words, and stood quite grave and
serious as we tried on the coat and gloves. They
fitted as if they had been made for him, and how
charming our Robin looked!</p>
<p>“I’ll have to be very good when I wear these,”
he remarked, quaintly:—but, alas, for resolutions!</p>
<p>As I said, we took our first walk this morning,
and Robin was so comfortable in his new chair
with the steamer rug tucked close about his little
thin legs! The street was full of his “friends,”
and Bobs beamed on them with gracious condescension.
A pretty glow of excitement burned in
his cheeks; his eyes were bright as stars; he did
not look like a little invalid boy.</p>
<p>“People will think I am riding just because I
am so Rich,” he remarked, looking down at his
fur-lined gloves;—and that moment turning the
corner of Washington Square, whom should we
meet but Georgie and his nurse, out for a morning
stroll, too.</p>
<p>“Hello!” says Georgie, his eyes nearly popping
out of his head with amazement,—“Where’d you
get those things?” For, naturally, he had never
seen Bobs attired so gorgeously before.</p>
<p>“Boy gave ’em to me,” answered Robin,
loftily.</p>
<p>“What boy?” questioned Georgie. And then
before Robin had time to reply,—“Pooh! I
wouldn’t take coats an’ things from anybody,
’cept just my papa. I’d be ashamed to wear
other people’s clothes!”</p>
<p>“No, you wouldn’t! Not the way I do!”
shouted Robin, with flashing eyes. “This coat
belongs to an Angel, I’d like to have you know!
And nobody’d let you wear it,—you’re too
bad!”</p>
<p>“Robin! Robin!” I cried. “What would
Francis think if he could hear you now?”</p>
<p>Robin instantly subsided; and, indeed, it was
not necessary for him to say more. Georgie was
quite quelled and done for. The idea of the Angel
coat was more than he could grapple with.
He walked along beside the chair in a state of
wondering, but subdued, solemnity.</p>
<p>After a while he began timidly to stroke the
fur on Robin’s cuff.</p>
<p>“Is it warm?” he asked.</p>
<p>“Yes, it is,” answered Robin, still a trifle defiant.</p>
<p>“Suppose you tell Georgie about the things,”
I said,—for Robin was clever enough to appreciate
that the impression he had created, though
delightful to his vanity, was not strictly in accordance
with fact.</p>
<p>“Well,” he muttered, unwillingly, “Francis is
an angel now, and this was his coat. And I’m
sick like he was, and good, too, and that’s why I
needn’t be ashamed to wear it.”</p>
<p>“So long as you <i>stay</i> good,” I answered.</p>
<p>And Robin blushed and hung his head, while
Georgie sighed. He did not entirely understand,
even yet, but somehow the tension of his prosaic
little mind was relieved.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, he was very respectful and polite
to Robin all the rest of the walk, and the explanation
must have set him thinking, I suppose, for
this afternoon while Bobs was upstairs taking a
nap, who should appear at our door but Georgie,
this time under the care of William, the coloured
butler.</p>
<p>“Here,” he said, handing me a square package,
prettily done up with tissue paper and red ribbon.
“This is for Bobbie, because he is sick. Tell him
it’s the one with the picture of the tiger. He
likes that best, but I like the Brownie Books.”</p>
<p>“Oh, thank you, Georgie dear,” I said, kissing
his little ruddy face. “What made you think to
bring it over?”</p>
<p>“I wanted him to have something to ’muse
himself with,” said Georgie, “and mamma said I
might, if only I would stop teasing.”</p>
<p>“It was very kind of you, honey,” I answered,
and Georgie beamed.</p>
<p>Sometimes I am ready to admit that I am unjust
to Georgie. It isn’t his fault that he has all
the things I want for Robin, to be sure.</p>
<p>And now I must write something that I dread
to put down in black and white;—but there is no
use shirking. We have to face it. The Hancocks
are going! The news came quite unexpectedly
to us all, and it is nobody’s fault.</p>
<p>Mrs. Hancock saw mother this evening, and
explained that Mr. Hancock’s married sister had
come to the city and taken a furnished house, and
it had always been understood between them that
when this happened she and Mr. Hancock would
rent a floor. She said she was really sorry to
leave us, that she had no complaints to make;
but they were anxious to be settled before Christmas,
and felt obliged to give up their rooms next
Saturday. That would give us a whole week in
which to rent them, and she hoped we would
have no trouble.</p>
<p>But, oh dear! we haven’t even had any applications
for Mrs. Hudson’s room yet. It seems
to be an unlucky season, or something, and when
the Hancocks go, I don’t see how we are going
to get on at all!</p>
<p>We will have only Miss Brown left, and she
pays less than anybody else because her room is
so small. Can a family of seven people live on
ten dollars a week? That sounds like a problem
in a Lady’s Magazine; but I fancy the answer
will prove very different from those printed, if
we are unlucky enough to have to try it.</p>
<p>“I have such a queer feeling whenever I look
at Miss Brown,” confessed Ernie, as we put
away the dinner dishes,—Rose having begged for
an unexpected afternoon out. “Sort of as if we
were a Cannibal family, and she was the last captive
we had left. Just think, she means muttonchops,
and beefsteak, and milk for Robin, and
butter, and eggs, and everything except rent!
We must guard her carefully, Elizabeth, and see
to it that she does not escape!”</p>
<p>Poor Miss Brown! I had had somewhat the
same feeling myself, though I would not have
thought of expressing it in exactly Ernie’s
words.</p>
<p>I think mother must have guessed from our
faces how worried we were, for, as soon as the
dishes were finished, she sat down at the piano
and began to play the jolliest lot of college airs.
And soon we were all singing and laughing; to
hear us you wouldn’t have thought we had a care
in the world. Certainly, for a time we forgot
we had! Even Haze shut up his Cæsar, and
joined in the frolic.</p>
<p>Now wasn’t that exactly like mother,—and no
one but her?</p>
<p>“We’ll think it out together, Elizabeth,” she
whispered, as I bade her good-night. “Don’t
worry, dear.”</p>

<h2 class='mt2em mb1em fs1r0em chapter'>Monday, December 15.</h2>
</div></div>
<p class='ti0'>Mother and I have had our consultation,
and we feel better. It was rather like a
general and his adjutant preparing for a siege.
First, we mustered our resources,—the house; so
much coal in the cellar, furnace, and range; Miss
Brown’s seven dollars a week, Hazard’s three:
next, the demands that were to be met,—lighting
(always an expensive item at this season of the
year); milk for Robin; and the table expenses
generally.</p>
<p>“The first thing to be done is to dispense with
Rose,” said mother, pencil on lip. “Apart from
the question of wages, she eats a great deal!”</p>
<p>At this we could not help laughing. The
parsimonious picture presented was certainly
ludicrous;—but, on an income of ten dollars a
week, every potato counts, and Rose has never
been either efficient or economical. We have
kept her for her cheapness and general good
temper. She has washed the dishes, cooked,
after a fashion, and attended a <i>great</i> many
funerals,—apparently the more the merrier.</p>
<p>“It’s ma cousin’s step-brudder’s lil’ boy, dis
time, Mis’ Graham,” she explained to mother,
Saturday afternoon. “That ain’ no very close
kin, ’cordin’ to some folks’ way ob reckonin’, Ah
know. But Ah’m one o’ them that believes in
keepin’ up the dispectability ob the fambly tie.
C’n Ah go?”</p>
<p>Of course, mother answered that she might,
and consequently Ernie and I washed the dinner
dishes. So, though perhaps Rose will be sorry
to leave us, since she once confessed to Robin in
an unconsidered burst of confidence, she considers
us “a right sma’t fambly to do fer,” we
cannot feel that she will be much of a loss; and,
as we know she can get a place any time she
wants it with her sister “at a swell boa’ding house
in the fash’nable distric’s,” we are relieved of
responsibility on that score.</p>
<p>So now it is settled;—and after next Saturday
when the Hancocks leave we are to do everything
ourselves, washing, cooking, sweeping, and all.
I can’t say that I look forward to the experiment
with any particular “thrill,” but mother is great
to work with, and somehow we’ll pull through.</p>
<p>“Perhaps you will be willing to admit by this
time, Elizabeth,” remarked Haze this evening,
looking up from <i>Treasure Island</i>, “that I was
right, and you were wrong. My salary comes in
pretty conveniently just at present, eh?”</p>
<p>Certainly, Haze’s salary is one of the things
we are counting on,—but, for all that, I can’t help
grieving over him, poor dear. Though he does
not utter a word of complaint, I know he realises
more keenly every day the magnitude of the
sacrifice he has made. He was not cut out for a
business-man and finds it hard to adjust himself
to the new conditions.</p>
<p>This very morning he was in trouble, over
<i>Treasure Island</i>, if you please! Ernie got the
book from the public library Saturday, expecting
to read it herself; but, unfortunately, when she
went to Sunday-school yesterday afternoon, she
left it lying open on the workshop table. Haze
strolled in, carelessly picked it up, and began to
read. Naturally, when Ernie came home a
couple of hours later, she demanded her story,—but
pleadings and protestations were of no avail.
Hazard would not even answer,—apparently he
was deaf to all remarks. So Ernie lost patience,
at last, and tried to snatch the book away; at
which Haze rose, dazed yet dignified, placed it on
his chair, and calmly sat down on it.</p>
<p>“I think you’re too mean for anything,” cried
Ernie, with flashing eyes. “You haven’t any
<i>right</i> to take my story and keep it from me, just
because you are stronger than I am!”</p>
<p>“Don’t be a dog in the manger,” returned Hazard,
loftily. “You can’t possibly expect to read
the thing while I’m sitting on it, can you? Go
away and find something useful to do. You’re
only wasting both our time here, and naturally,
when I’ve finished it, I’ll give it back.”</p>
<p>Ernie stamped and fumed, quite unable to appreciate
the fine logic of this position; but Haze
sat stolidly on, till at last she gave in,—she is always
a generous child,—and Hazard arose, resumed
his story, and read rabidly till bedtime.
Even so, however, he did not finish the book, and
took it with him this morning to read on the trolley;—in
consequence of which he was carried
seven blocks out of his way, and arrived a quarter
of an hour late at the office!</p>
<p>Mr. Bridges, who is something of a disciplinarian
and determined to show no partiality,
“jumped on him like anything” he confessed to
Ernie and me this evening,—“And, of course,”
says Haze, “though I objected to the language
he used, I was not in a position to resent it,—which
comes of being an office boy!”</p>
<p>“Never mind,” purred nice little Ernie, immediately
forgetful of any rancour she herself
may have been cherishing. “Some day you’ll
surprise them all, Hazard. They don’t appreciate
you yet, dear,—but we know, don’t we,
Elizabeth? Just let ’em wait a bit, and they’ll
see!”</p>

<h2 class='mt2em mb1em fs1r0em chapter'>Thursday, December 18.</h2>
</div></div>
<p class='ti0'>Tuesday I received an invitation from
Aunt Adelaide to dine with them yesterday
evening. I was to bring my mandolin, and after
dinner Meta and I were to play from <i>Iolanthe</i>.
The fairy music is very pretty on the mandolin.</p>
<p>There were to be a number of guests: an Englishman
and his wife, a railroad president, and
several others. Aunt Adelaide extends me one
or two such informal invitations each winter. I
expect she considers it her duty,—besides which
it lends support to Meta, and two mandolins are
better than one.</p>
<p>Naturally, the first question was as to clothes.
Aunt Adelaide sees to it that two or three of
Meta’s last season’s dresses are sent to me spring
and fall. They are always <i>chic</i>, always pretty,
and as we are very nearly of a size, they require
little alteration. Yet, somehow, I hate to wear
them,—especially in their native habitat, where I
am perpetually haunted by the discomforting suggestion
that they must be fatally familiar to all.
However, it is expected; and Ernie declares that
I ought to be grateful, since I am thus “provided
with a wardrobe far above my station.”</p>
<p>She is too young to understand that that is just
what I do not like. Last evening I wore a graceful
little white surah frilled frock, garnished
with artificial forget-me-nots. The idea! for a
girl who expects to start in on the family-wash
come Monday.</p>
<p>Uncle George’s house, as I have remarked before,
is very imposing. There is a magnificent
display of plate-glass windows, a flight of broad
stone steps, and a really oppressive vestibule.</p>
<p>I was admitted by William, the coloured man,
who took my instrument, and told me that “Miss
Meta was above stairs; would I please go right
up?”</p>
<p>Such a charming room as Meta has,—all rose
and mossy green, with soft rugs, a desk, a bookcase,
her favourite casts and photographs!
Everything individual and personal,—which
seems to me the greatest treat of all.</p>
<p>“Come in!” she answered to my knock, and
turned half round before the cheval-glass, a pout
upon her pretty face.</p>
<p>“Oh, Meta!” I cried, “how charming!” For
the dress of which she was evidently trying the
effect before the mirror was truly lovely,—a Nile
green rajah silk, with lace under-sleeves and a
touch of amber fluff at the throat.</p>
<p>“Do you think so?” returned Meta, “You
haven’t really seen it yet. Come and look how
this shoulder pulls. Now wouldn’t that jar
you!”</p>
<p>“There isn’t much amiss,” I answered. “The
underseam wants to be let out a little, that’s all.”</p>
<p>“I declare I’ll give Miss Murray fits,” returned
Meta, her face flushing unpleasantly. “It was
all I could do to get her to promise the thing for
to-night, and then to send it home like this!
She’s a big fake,—forever working on mamma’s
sympathies with that cough of hers! I’m going
to change, Elizabeth, see if I don’t! All the
girls are going to Madam Delahasset, now; and
I don’t see why I should be made to look like a
frump, just because Miss Murray is delicate, and
has a pair of aged parents to support!”</p>
<p>“You’re exaggerating, Meta,” I returned.
“There is nothing the least frumpish about that
frock. It’s the prettiest thing I have seen in
ages,—and as to the shoulder, that’s easily
remedied, and might have happened with any
one.”</p>
<p>“Do you really think so?” asked Meta, uncertainly.</p>
<p>“Why, of course I do,” I replied. “And what
is more, I think Miss Murray is a wonder—always
so <i>chic</i> and original.”</p>
<p>“Well, I’m glad you like it,” admitted Meta,
who is not difficult to bring around if only one is
firm enough. “Mamma believes in her; but
there is nothing that upsets me so much as a new
frock. See,—won’t my amber buckle be the very
ticket with this girdle?”</p>
<p>“It’s stunning,” I returned, and threw my hat
and gloves upon the bed.</p>
<p>“You look well yourself, Elizabeth,” continued
Meta, turning, jewel-case in hand, to sweep me
an approving glance. “Somehow, I never appreciate
how nice my things are till I see them on
you. Those bunches of forget-me-nots, for instance,
didn’t look half so cute when I wore them.
But, mercy, child—what have you been doing
with your hands?”</p>
<p>“Dish-washing,” I was forced to admit. “Are
they very bad?”</p>
<p>“H’m’m,” returned Meta, in dubious assent.
“It wouldn’t matter so much if we didn’t have to
play. Don’t you ever use cold cream?” And
then, quickly, before I had time to reply,—</p>
<p>“How can you bear it, Elizabeth?—truly, now,—your
life, I mean?”</p>
<p>“My life?” I questioned. “You want me to
answer honestly? Well, first place, it’s interesting;
one never has a moment to be bored. Of
course, there are plenty of worries, and a good
deal happens that one doesn’t like; but the planning
is exciting, and the sense of battle. Then,
too, there are such lots of <i>funny</i> things! I’m
convinced that nothing develops one’s sense of
humour like being poor,—and it teaches one to
love one’s family, and gives one plenty of chance
to show it, too, without being sentimental; and,
oh,—it’s good training in other ways. For
instance, it would take a lot more than a new
frock to upset me, Meta, and——”</p>
<p>Here I stopped, amazed. Either it was pride
that made me answer so, or I had suddenly discovered
that being poor is not altogether such
bad luck! I, who have kicked so determinedly
against the pricks;—longing for the luxuries we
can’t afford;—resentful of Georgie because for
him they are afforded. Well, I must do better
now. Since, among the thorns, there are roses
to be found, why not pluck and wear them?</p>
<p>Meta still stood before the mirror, trying the
effect of the amber buckle.</p>
<p>“I don’t understand a word you’ve been saying,”
she confessed. “I’m afraid you’re talking
through your hat, Elizabeth. But, come on.
Let’s go down now—I’m ready, since you think
my rags will do.”</p>
<p>And we proceeded to the drawing-room, where
we found Aunt Adelaide and a number of guests
already assembled.</p>
<p>Geof did not appear till dinner was announced.
He sat next me, and after an unenthusiastic
greeting began upon the oysters. It was evident
he was in one of his moods.</p>
<p>“How’s hockey coming on, Geof?” I asked,
under cover of the general conversation.</p>
<p>“It’s not coming on at all,” returned Geof,
glumly. “Probably shan’t play any more this
season.”</p>
<p>“What!” I replied, for Geof is captain of his
school team, a crack player, fast, and wonderfully
clever. “Not even the Lakeville match? I
thought you had it all arranged!”</p>
<p>“So we have,” muttered Geof, crumbling a bit
of bread between his fingers. “The match’ll
come off, all right;—under a different captain,
that’s all.”</p>
<p>“Oh, Geoffrey!” I said; for I saw by his face
and the nervous movements of his hand how
deeply the matter cut. “What has happened?
You’re not in trouble again at school?”</p>
<p>“I’d get on all right at school,” returned Geof,
sullenly, “if only they’d stop nagging at home.
It seems the Governor’s not pleased with my reports,—one
can’t especially blame him for that,—and
the ultimatum’s gone forth that I am to give
up athletics,—my place on the team and all.
He’s put up to it, of course. I’m sharp enough
to know that.”</p>
<p>“But, Geoffrey,” I said, “if scholarship is the
only difficulty, why don’t you buckle down and
study? Aunt Adelaide is really anxious about
you. Her motives are good,—and, after all, the
matter rests in your own hands,—it isn’t hockey,
as <i>hockey</i>, that is objected to. You know that.”</p>
<p>Geof turned from me. I saw that I would receive
no further answer; and yet I felt sorry for
the poor fellow, stubborn and headstrong as I
know him to be.</p>
<p>When we returned to the drawing-room,
Meta, Geof, and I retired to a window-recess,
where we felt ourselves screened from observation.</p>
<p>“Mamma’s evenings are so dull,” Meta began,
plaintively. “One puts on one’s best clothes, and
then nothing happens at all! Seventeen is a hateful
age anyway, it seems to me. One is not
grown up, and yet one is no longer a kid. Fancy,
Elizabeth! mamma says I am not to come out till
I am twenty! Did you ever hear anything so
unjust? All this talk about education makes me
tired.”</p>
<p>“<i>Much</i> you have to complain of,” jeered Geof;—“a
fudge party every other week, and girls so
thick about the house one can’t move without
stepping on ’em!”</p>
<p>“Oh, I’m not trying to infringe your patent,”
replied Meta, smartly. “Did you know, Elizabeth,
that Geof has taken out a patent on martyrdom,
since he’s been forbidden athletics? He has
even got to give up his beloved hockey. It’s a
national misfortune, let me tell you.”</p>
<p>“That’s all you know about it,” returned Geof.
“But who’d expect you to understand, anyhow?
You haven’t an atom of sport in your make-up!”</p>
<p>He raised an excited arm as he spoke, and as
ill luck would have it struck Meta rather sharply
on the side of the head. I should have laughed
had I been in her place, for it was not really much
of a blow, and we were crowded so against the
window-seat that accidents were only natural.
But she cried out,—</p>
<p>“Geof! stop that! You hurt me!”</p>
<p>And Uncle George, who was standing near
enough to overhear the exclamation, turned and
rumbled in that heavy bass of his,—“Are you
teasing your sister, sir? Leave the room;—since
you can’t conduct yourself like a gentleman.”</p>
<p>Geof jumped up and looked at Meta, as if expecting
her to explain; I waited, too; but never a
word did she say. Then Geoffrey, very red and
stormy, walked toward the door. How sorry I
felt; for every one had turned at Uncle George’s
voice, and it sounded brutal,—the way one would
order a dog.</p>
<p>“Meta!” I whispered; “how could you? It
was an accident—you know that perfectly
well!”</p>
<p>Meta raised her hand to her hair with an airy
little laugh. “He mussed my pompadour, all the
same,” she explained. “And besides, Geof will
understand. He knows perfectly well that I
owed him one.”</p>
<p>I turned away, shocked and disgusted, and
presently Aunt Adelaide asked us to play.</p>
<p>The music went well enough: people applauded,
and declared it delightful; but, so far as
I was concerned, the evening had proved anything
but a success.</p>
<p>About half-past nine I made my <i>adieus</i>, and
was conducted home under the wing of the dignified
and awe-inspiring William.</p>
<p>Well, I had not had a pleasant time, but I think
I learned a lesson. Meta’s question and my unexpected
answer in return. Certainly, there <i>are</i>
advantages in being poor;—for, under given circumstances,
one would have to be so very selfish
to be selfish at all, that that in itself is a safeguard.</p>
<p>Poor Geof! poor Meta! I lay awake and
thought of them late into the night. They waste
so much that is good and pleasant, and are not
nearly as happy as any of us, whom they often
pity, I feel sure.</p>

<h2 class='mt2em mb1em fs1r0em chapter'>Friday, December 19.</h2>
</div></div>
<p class='ti0'>This morning, as Rose was sweeping the
pavement in front of our house, she was
accosted by a small boy with ruddy cheeks and a
red cap.</p>
<p>“Is he dead?” asked the small boy, his head interrogatively
to one side, a half-expectant, half-wistful
light in his twinkling blue eyes.</p>
<p>“Dead?” says Rose, with a little skip.
“Who?”</p>
<p>“Why, him,” specified the small boy, ungrammatically
insistent. “The little chap which used
to sit in the winder and watch us play. I haven’t
seen him for three days.”</p>
<p>“Of course he ain’t dead,” answered Rose, indignantly,
for, with all her faults, she is very
fond of Robin. “Ah guess he can stay in bed
if he wan’ster without askin’ you! Shoo! get
along!” and she swished viciously at the boy with
her broom.</p>
<p>“Then give him this,” cried the red-capped
one, hopping nimbly to safety in the gutter; and
rolled a great golden orange to her feet. “I
bought it with my own pennies to eat in school;
but I’d rather he had it,—as long as he isn’t
dead.” And he walked whistling down the
street.</p>
<p>It was Robin’s “chum” John, to be sure,—and
how Bobsie <i>did</i> enjoy that orange!</p>
<p>“It isn’t everybody who has such good friends
as me,” he remarked with gusto, between unctuous
sucks. “There’s Mrs. Burroughs, who
sends over chairs an’ things just when you least
expect it; and Francis, who wants me to have
’em (she said I might count him); an’ Georgie,
even if we do fight sometimes; an’ my chum John.
It’s pleasant to have people love you, isn’t it,
Ellie dear?—and very comforting, too.”</p>
<p>In one instance, certainly, the comfort seems
to be mutual. Mrs. Burroughs has run in to see
Robin several times this last week. They laugh
and chatter away together in the jolliest fashion.
Indeed, it is quite delightful to hear them; for
Bobs has not a particle of shyness with his new
friend, while she seems to find an almost painful
pleasure in his society. The more we see her,
the sweeter we think her; and there was not a
dissenting voice when Ernie declared this evening
that “Mrs. Burroughs is next door to an
angel.”</p>

<h2 class='mt2em mb1em fs1r0em chapter'>Saturday, December 20.</h2>
</div></div>
<p class='ti0'>Rose left us this afternoon with many protestations
of affectionate regard.—</p>
<p>“If ever you wan’ me, jus’ call upon me, Mis’
Graham,” she said to mother. “Ah’m ready to
come back any time, at $18 a mont’, and no questions
arst.”</p>
<p>I must say it seemed rather nice to have the
kitchen to ourselves, the closet shelves all tidy
and ship-shape, and clean sash curtains in the
windows.</p>
<p>I was to get my first dinner alone, for poor little
Robin had had a wretched night, and been in
so much pain during the day that we had finally
decided to send for the doctor. He was expected
at any moment, and mother had to be ready to receive
him.</p>
<p>The potatoes were bubbling pleasantly away on
the hottest part of the stove, the steak was salted
and peppered on the gridiron, ready for broiling,
and I had just run in to the dining-room to take
a last survey of the table before sitting down to
cut up the oranges, when there sounded a <i>tap-tap</i>
on the window-pane, and looking up, I saw Hazard’s
anxious face peering in at me.</p>
<p>Naturally I ran to the basement door to let
him in.</p>
<p>“Is anything the matter, Haze?” I asked,—for
he has a latchkey, and it seemed odd that he
should tap at the window.</p>
<p>“Hush, Elizabeth,” he answered. “I don’t
want ’em to know that I’m home just yet.” And
he preceded me into the dining-room, threw his
cap upon a chair, sat despairingly down on it, and
buried his head in his arms across the chair-back.</p>
<p>“What has happened, Hazard?” I asked, anxiously.</p>
<p>Haze swallowed hard, looked up, and then let
his head drop down on his arm again.</p>
<p>“Do answer me, Haze,” I urged. “<i>What</i> is
the matter? You aren’t dismissed, are you?”</p>
<p>“Not this time,” returned Haze, unsteadily,
“but, from our point of view, it’s all the same as
if I were.” And then, in an ashamed and broken
voice, the poor boy started in to tell his
story.</p>
<p>It seems that he was sent by Mr. Bridges this
morning to collect a small debt for the firm.
Haze got the money without any trouble, and
started at a clip down the office stairs, because the
elevator was several flights up, and he wanted to
break the record, so to speak, and accomplish his
errand in such short time that Mr. Bridges, whose
special hobby is promptitude, would be forced to
notice and commend him. When he reached the
curb there was no car in sight, and Hazard happened
to remember that he had not counted his
money. Of course he knew that it must be all
right, for the firm he was dealing with is perfectly
trustworthy and reputable. However, to make
sure, Haze thrust his hand into his coat pocket,
drew out the little wad of bills, and proceeded to
verify them.—There were two tens, a two, and
three ones, in all twenty-five dollars, which was
the correct sum.</p>
<p>Haze stood with the money in his hand, thinking
how nice it would be to have that amount to
spend on Christmas, till presently a down-town
car came bowling along, Haze thrust the bills hurriedly
into the outside pocket of his overcoat, and
swung on.</p>
<p>There was a fine-looking, white-bearded old
gentleman standing on the back platform. He
caught Haze by the arm, and steadied him.</p>
<p>“Young blood will have its way,” he remarked,
in admiring reproof. “Some forty years ago I
swung aboard the cars in just such style myself.”</p>
<p>“Thank you, sir. That’s all right,” says Haze,
never stopping to think that it must have been
stage coaches the old gentleman swung aboard.</p>
<p>“Pleasant weather,” remarked Hazard’s new
friend, presently. “Crisp, but not too keen. I
see you are like myself, and prefer the view from
the back platform here, to the stuffy atmosphere
within. Oh, the poetry of a great city!” he observed
again. “There’s romance here as fine and
true as any hid away amid the snowcapped hills
and sheltered valleys of my native state. Judging
from your physiognomy, my boy, you are of the
fibre to appreciate all that. The brow of a
scholar, above the ardent eyes of a poet!”</p>
<p>“Thank you, sir,” says Hazey again, blushing
a bit, and thinking, I haven’t a doubt, what a
nice, appreciative old gentleman he had run
across. “I do like to watch the city, and listen to
its hum. It’s like wheels within a wheel. If you
can keep your place, and pace, all right;—otherwise——”</p>
<p>“Otherwise,” concluded the old gentleman, his
eyes fixed abstractedly upon the guard, who had
walked the length of the car, and was fumbling
with the door handle,—“Otherwise, it is what
one might call—<i>bum</i>!”</p>
<p>And then, much to the surprise of Hazard, he
hopped lightly to the step, swung himself off the
car with a really amazing agility for one of his
years, and disappeared among the throng.</p>
<p>Haze was still staring blankly after him when
he felt a touch upon his shoulder. “Fare,
please,” said the guard.</p>
<p>Haze felt in his overcoat pocket for the nickel,
and turned pale. The wad of bills was gone!
He had been robbed.</p>
<p>“And the worst of it is,” added Hazard, “that
I shall have to make good out of my salary.
That means I won’t be able to pay another cent
to the family for eight weeks, Elizabeth. And
I’d planned what I was going to give you all for
Christmas,—and—and Mr. Bridges called me a
<i>calf</i> before the entire office! I can stand most
things,” concluded poor Hazey, with an angry
sort of gulp, “but not, <i>not</i> an ’ninsult!”</p>
<p>Of course I comforted him as well as I could,
and told him I would break the matter to mother.
But, oh! it took all my courage, I can tell you,
when she came down a few moments later, white-faced,
and so tired-looking, after her interview
with the doctor.</p>
<p>There was no use waiting, however, till after
dinner. We should have to wash the dishes then,
and she would want to return to Robin. So I
began as cheerfully as I could, and mother listened,
half as if she had expected it.</p>
<p>“Who could ever suppose that three dollars a
week would seem so much?” she said, at last.
“Well, we can’t have any Christmas spree, that’s
all. I’m sorry, dears, but I do not dare draw
anything from the bank. There is only $300
left,—and we may need it all, later.”</p>
<p>Somehow, in the back of my brain I have half
a suspicion what mother fears we may need that
money for. But I am not going to ask her and
make sure. I haven’t the courage, that’s all.</p>
<p>“<i>Mother!</i>” protested Ernie, who had come
down to the kitchen in time to hear mother’s last
words. “No Christmas spree! What will
Robin think?”</p>
<p>“There, there,” said mother, almost harshly.
“It can’t be helped, Ernestine. Get the blue
dish for the potatoes, and then ring the gong.
We mustn’t keep Miss Brown waiting.”</p>
<p>So dinner was served; but though Miss Brown
was really very nice, and said that everything was
“delicious,” and she thought we should find the
new régime a real improvement on the old, I
could not feel much pleasure in her praise.</p>
<p>“Shall I tell you something?” asked Ernie, unexpectedly,
as she set a dish of milk for Rosebud
on the hearth, after the table was cleared and Miss
Brown had gone upstairs. “Well, Uncle George
is a devil. There!”</p>
<p>“Ernie,” said mother, turning in the doorway
with Robin’s tray, which she was about to carry
to the nursery, “I don’t wish you to speak that
way. It is not right. Uncle George has been a
good friend to us, according to his lights, and in
this instance the fault is entirely with Hazard. He
was foolish and careless, and we cannot expect
an exception to be made in his case. It was
against my wishes that he took a position,—now
it lies with himself to make the best of it, and to
try to overcome those faults of character which
prevent his being the comfort and support to me
that I have a right to expect.”</p>
<p>Poor Hazey, who was helping dry the dishes,
blushed to the roots of his hair, and dropped a
cup and smashed it.</p>
<p>Oh, dear! I do feel so sorry for <i>everybody</i>!
That big splash is a tear;—and to-night there
just <i>don’t</i> seem to be any roses, so there!</p>
</div>
<div class='chapter' id='d1222'>
<div class='rb-container'><div class='rb'>
<h2 class='mt2em mb1em fs1r0em chapter'>Monday, December 22.</h2>
</div></div>
<p class='ti0'>All last night the wind whistled and howled
about the house. This morning we woke
to a snowstorm of almost blizzard proportions.
And, oh, but the atmosphere was arctic!</p>
<p>“You get up first,” says Ernie, poking her little
pink nose above the bed-covers.</p>
<p>“Indeed, I’ll do nothing of the sort,” I answered.
“It’s <i>your</i> turn.”</p>
<p>“I thought you loved me, Elizabeth!” wailed
Ernestine, reproachfully.</p>
<p>“So I do,” I answered, and hopped heroically
forth to the glacial matting.</p>
<p>Ernie followed with hysterical giggles,—and I
can tell you it did not take us long to dress!</p>
<p>Fortunately Miss Brown had gone to spend
Sunday with a niece in Flatbush, so we did not
have her to worry about. Mother made the nursery
as comfortable as possible at the sacrifice of
heavy inroads upon our precious stock of coal,
and there Haze, Ernie, Robin, and I passed the
morning. For Haze was taken ill Sunday night
with a sharp attack of laryngitis, and was still
unfit for the office; and we did not think it wise
for Ernie to attempt to make her way to school
through the snowdrifts. But, though it is not
often now that we have the chance of a day together,
it was not especially jolly.</p>
<p>Poor Hazey squatted on the register, very
hoarse and gloomy, pegging away at his eternal
Cæsar; I darned stockings, and understood just
how it was that Rose had used to be cross on a
stormy Monday; while Ernie, hid in a corner
behind a series of screens that she had contrived,
sang carols and asked ridiculous riddles, busy as
she declared upon “a secret.”</p>
<p>As for Robin, he sat in his shabby little grey
flannel dressing-gown, propped up with pillows
in the middle of mother’s big bed, talking about
Santa Claus and the things he wanted for Christmas.—</p>
<p>“I’ve been good for three weeks,” he boasted
vaingloriously. “I’ve taken my cod-liver oil,—haven’t
I, Elizabeth? And I’ve finished the First
Reader, and learned to spell <i>squirrel</i>! Hope old
Santa knows about it, ’cause I want a lot o’
things!”</p>
<p>“Why don’t you write a letter, and tell him
what you want?” suggested Ernie.</p>
<p>Whereat, Hazard scowled at her over his
Cæsar, and I shook my head warningly; but it
was already too late. Robin caught gleefully at
the suggestion.</p>
<p>“I will,” he piped. “Bring me some paper and
a pencil, Elizabeth. Hurry up, now, honey!”
For Bobsie dearly loves to write letters, and the
fact that no one can read them but himself does
not dampen his enthusiasm in the least.</p>
<p>“What is the difference,” sang out Ernie,
blithely, while I searched mother’s desk for a
half-sheet of note paper, “between a horse and
an egg?”</p>
<p>“There’s no difference between you and a donkey,”
growled Hazard.</p>
<p>“Well, I like that!” retorted Ernestine; while
Robin, after a vigorous suck at the stump of pencil
I had handed him, began unctuously upon his
letter.</p>
<p>“<i>Dear Santa Claus</i>,” he muttered,—</p>
<p>“<i>I want the Mowgli books</i>,—”</p>
<p>“<i>Jungle Books</i>,” corrected Ernie.</p>
<p>“—<i>and a horse just like Georgie’s</i>,” continued
Robin, with a flourish.</p>
<p>“Why not a little, white, cuddly, flannel rabbit
with pink eyes?” suggested Ernestine. “You
could take that to bed with you, you know, Robin,
and the horse would have to sleep in a stall in the
closet, which wouldn’t be nearly so convenient!”</p>
<p>“Yes, <i>a little white flannel rabbit with pink
eyes</i>,” corrected Robin, obligingly. “<i>And a
steamboat what can whistle, and a box of building
blocks, an’</i>——”</p>
<p>But here Haze slammed to his book.</p>
<p>“Shut up, Bobs,” he commanded, roughly.
“What’s the good? There isn’t any Santa Claus,
and you might just as well know it now, as——”
but there he stopped; for Robin was staring
at him with such round frightened eyes that Ernie
and I cried out together,—</p>
<p>“Oh, Hazard! how can you! You ought to
be ashamed!”</p>
<p>Haze opened his book again. “I don’t care,”
he muttered. “There isn’t any use in his running
on like that. He isn’t going to get anything; we
all know it, and——”</p>
<p>But Bobsie cried, “I will, too! I’ve taken my
cod-liver oil, I tell you!”</p>
<p>And Ernie, running to his side, flung her arms
protectingly about him. “Of course you have,
honey,” she crooned, “and of course you’ll get
some presents! Hazard is only teasing. The
idea of there not being any Santa Claus! Who
gave you your things last year, I’d like to know?”</p>
<p>Robin’s chin was beginning to quiver, and two
great teardrops blinked on the ends of his long
lashes. He held his arms tight about Ernie’s
neck, and cuddled up against her side.</p>
<p>Haze looked at them a moment, threw his book
aside, and strode from the room, I following.</p>
<p>“Hazard!” I began, as soon as the door had
shut upon us. “It was cruel! How could you
do such a thing?”</p>
<p>“Don’t bother!” answered Haze, gruffly. “I
didn’t intend to say it that way, but—Robin <i>isn’t</i>
going to get anything. I couldn’t bear to have
him go on like that, and know it was all my fault,
and,—oh, let me alone, Elizabeth!”</p>
<p>And, shaking my hand from his arm, he
turned and bolted upstairs, where I heard the
workshop door slam to behind him.</p>
<p>Naturally, if the rest of the house is cold, you
can imagine what it must be in the workshop. I
was very much afraid that Hazard would add to
his sore throat; but I knew it would do no good
to speak to him just then, so I returned to the
nursery, where Ernie was still sitting on the
side of the bed, her arms close about Robin,
whispering to him in the most seductive of
tones.</p>
<p>“Yes, he looked just like the pictures, Bobsie,”
she was saying. “It was in front of Macy’s
that we met, and I think he must have been looking
about at the toys. I was very much surprised,
of course; but I went right up to him, and
said,—‘How do you do, Mr. Santa Claus? I’m
Robin Graham’s sister.’”</p>
<p>“Did you, Ernie!” cried Robin, with shining
eyes. “And what did he say?”</p>
<p>“I can’t tell you that,” returned Ernie, mysteriously,
“because it is a secret. But don’t you
worry, honey; <i>everything is going to be all
right</i>!”</p>
<p>Here I thought it time to interfere; for, though
Hazard had been hasty and even unkind in the
way he spoke, still we all knew that Robin was
not going to get anything for Christmas,—so
what was the use of comforting him with false
hopes that could only lead to a still more bitter
disappointment?</p>
<p>“Run down and set the table, Ernie,” I said, a
little dryly. “It’s time for Robin to have his
reading lesson, now.”</p>
<p>Bobsie looked at me half shyly under his dark
lashes.</p>
<p>“I have a Secret,” he said, and gave Ernie a
long kiss before he let her go.</p>
<p>After luncheon, while we were washing the
dishes, I asked Ernestine what she meant by
talking to Robin so. “There is no good in deceiving
him,” I said. “Of course, Hazard did
not set about it in the right way, but sooner or
later he will have to be told. He isn’t going to
get anything. You heard what mother said.”</p>
<p>Ernie looked at me in blank amazement.
“Why, Elizabeth!” she cried.</p>
<p>“Ernestine,” I returned, “remember,—you are
nearly thirteen years old! Do you believe in
Santa Claus, too?”</p>
<p>Ernie laughed and flapped her dish towel.
“Of course I do,” she answered, “after my own
fashion. You and Hazard are too silly! Mother
didn’t mean, I suppose, that she was going to
take away all the presents that come to the house
for Robin, and burn them? She only meant that
we couldn’t spend any money. What’s to prevent
Aunt Adelaide giving him something as she
always does, I’d like to know? and Georgie? and
Geof?” Here Ernie began to two-step to the
cupboard with a pile of plates. “Oh, Elizabeth,”
she chortled, “he says I can help him choose ’em!
Robin will be simply <i>de</i>lighted! He has never
had anything so stunning in all his life! But
there,”—Ernie rattled the plates perilously down
on the cupboard shelf. “It’s a secret. I promised
I wouldn’t breathe a word! And I know
another that Miss Brown told me, and <i>another</i>
with Mrs. Burroughs! Hazard is a grumpy
goose. Why can’t he think of something to give
Bobsie, the way I’m doing,—it needn’t cost, you
know,—instead of being so huffy and remorseful
about a Past that can’t be Helped?”</p>
<p>Now wasn’t that exactly like Ernie? Christmas
is her birthday, and she seems to have the
very spirit in her veins. If we were wrecked
upon a desert island, I believe she would still find
some appropriate way to celebrate.</p>
<p>“So <i>that</i> is what you were busy about behind
your screen?” I cried.</p>
<p>“Of course,” says Ernie. “What did you
think? You must make something, too, Elizabeth,
and I know mother will; and the letter was
just a blind to get Robin to believe he wanted the
things we can afford to give him. I thought you
and Hazard would understand.—And even if we
are poor, so long as we love one another and keep
jolly, what’s the odds?”</p>
<p>“Ernie,” I answered, “you are a darling.
<i>There aren’t any!</i>”</p>
<p>So then we sought an interview with Hazard
to explain how matters stood.</p>
<p>“All right,” he answered, none too enthusiastic
just at first. “I’ll try,—but it’s different with
you girls. I can’t make anything, you see,—little
fol-de-rols out of sawdust and gold paper.
And everything I’ve saved must go for car fare
and expenses these next few weeks. Honestly,
I haven’t a cent to call my own, except my lucky
penny of 1865, the year Lincoln was shot. And
perhaps I’ve lost that.” He searched his pockets.
“No,—here it is.”</p>
<p>“Hand it over,” says Ernie. “I know you’ll
think the best luck you can possibly have just now
is to buy a nice Christmas present for Robin. I’ll
do your shopping this year, Hazey, and I’ll
promise to get something Bobs will really like,
too. Cheer up, children! No Santa Claus, indeed!
I’m ashamed of you.”</p>

<div class='chapter' id='d1226'>
<div class='rb-container'><div class='rb'>
<h2 class='mt2em mb1em fs1r0em chapter'>Friday, December 26.</h2>
</div></div>
<p class='ti0'>Christmas has come and gone, and in
spite of our gloomy expectations we have
had the jolliest time. You would hardly believe
it! Oh,—there were plenty of roses!</p>
<p>The first nice thing that happened was on
Tuesday morning when mother received a letter
from Miss Brown, stating that she had been
asked to stay over the holidays with her niece in
Flatbush.</p>
<p>“Hurrah! hurrah!” carolled Ernie:</p>
<div class='cb-container'><div class='cb'>
<div>“Shout the glad tidings, exultantly sing,</div>
<div>Jerusalem triumphs, Messiah is king!”</div>
</div></div>
<p class='ti0'>She did not mean anything the least irreligious.
It was simply a spontaneous outburst of joy; and
at the same instant a mad enthusiasm seemed to
seize hold of us all.</p>
<p>“Let’s finish the breakfast dishes at once,
Elizabeth,” said mother. “I have some sewing
upstairs that I <i>must</i> attend to.”</p>
<p>“And there is something I must finish, too,”
answered I. “How considerate of Miss Brown’s
niece! Just think, our Christmas dinner alone!”</p>
<p>“<i>Have</i> you decided—<i>how</i> you are going—to
spend my <i>lucky penny</i>?” shouted Hazard from
the hall above. “You understand, Ernie,—I
want it to go—<i>as far as possible</i>!”</p>
<p>“Yes! yes!” answered Ernie. “I’ve a grand
idea! Don’t you worry, Hazard. Geof and I
are going shopping this afternoon after school.”</p>
<p>And so they did, and so did mother, and so did
I! It was really amusing. Nobody could be
prevailed upon to tell what had been bought, except
that “it was very cheap, dear. Don’t
worry!”</p>
<p>Then in the evening Ernie and I made old-fashioned
molasses candy, because it is less expensive
than fudge and we had determined to pull
it and twist it into original shapes, something
individual for each one. For Robin we made a
little yellow bird (I must confess it looked more
like a chicken than anything else), a boy with a
big hat and a crooked nose, and a pig with a curly
tail. Hazard’s candy we put peanuts in, and
did not pull, because he prefers it that way.
Mother’s we tied into a variety of charming bow-knots;
and Ernie made me a mandolin, and Geof
a hockey stick, while I made Ernie a Santa Claus.
He was a little wobbly in the legs, to be sure, but
any one could recognise him from his pack.</p>
<p>In the middle of it all Mrs. Burroughs came
over, full of her own plans.</p>
<p>“I do hope you won’t say no, Mrs. Graham,”
she pleaded. “I haven’t had any Christmas
fun—for ages!”</p>
<p>It seems that she wished to give a party for
Robin. “I will have it Wednesday night, Christmas
eve,” she explained. “So it needn’t interfere
with your family celebration in the least. May
I, <i>please</i>?”</p>
<p>“Why, it would be lovely,” we all answered
with enthusiasm. And Mrs. Burroughs flushed
a beautiful rose colour, and for a moment the
quick tears stood in her eyes.</p>
<p>“Thank you so much,” she answered. “Then
that’s settled. You see Francis and I used to
have such good times, and just the last year I got
him a magic lantern. It is really a very nice one,
and there are some charming slides. ‘<i>The Night
before Christmas</i>’ is the set Francis liked best,—especially
the pictures of the reindeer. I thought
we might give it for Robin, and perhaps you will
lend your back parlour for the occasion. We can
begin early,—say half-past seven. I wonder if
Hazard will consent to act as manager?”</p>
<p>“You’d better choose Geof,” warned Ernie.
“He’s cleverer at that sort of thing, and I’m sure
he’d like to come.”</p>
<p>So the matter was arranged. The following
afternoon,—to the intense excitement of Robin,—Mrs.
Burroughs, Geof, and Ernie shut themselves
up in the back parlour, from whence began
to issue the sound of much laughter and hammering.</p>
<p>Despite his impatience, it was not till quarter
to seven o’clock that the doors were finally thrown
open and Robin was carried down. How charming
everything looked, to be sure! Long loops
of ground-pine were festooned about the chandelier,
and along the picture-rail. A great
artificial Christmas bell hung in the doorway,
from either side of which dropped gay streamers
of baby-ribbon strung with sleigh-bells, that
jingled and sang in the merriest fashion at the
touch of a passing hand. In the window were
holly wreaths, and back of the Madonna over
the chimney-piece were two more great branches
of holly with the biggest, brightest berries I have
ever seen. A red Christmas candle burned upon
the piano. The old lounge, covered with a tiger
rug lent by Mrs. Burroughs, had been pushed out
into the middle of the room, and a series of “orchestra
chairs” arranged about it. Between the
folding doors the magic sheet was hung, and behind
it could be heard the voices of Geof and
Ernie in animated discussion.</p>
<p>Presently the guests began to arrive,—Georgie
and his nurse, Robin’s “chum” John, who had
been looked up especially for the occasion, because,
as Bobs persuasively explained, “it would
be pretty odd for a boy to give a party and not
ask his own chum”; old Mrs. Endicott, who
is Mrs. Burroughs’ aunt, and Rosebud, very
gay and debonair in a becoming red ribbon
bow.</p>
<p>“The audience is ready,” sang out Robin, from
his lair on the tiger skin. “What makes the
party so late, I’d like to know?”</p>
<p>“It isn’t late at all,” returned Mrs. Burroughs,
from behind the curtain. “The idea! we said
half-past seven o’clock, and it is only quarter
after. You are early! That’s all!”</p>
<p>However, in another moment Geof appeared
to turn down the lights. With a deep, expectant
sigh from Robin, Georgie, and John, the party
had begun!</p>
<p>The pictures were certainly charming, and
Geoffrey managed the slides without a hitch.</p>
<p>First came “<i>The Night before Christmas</i>”:—Santa
Claus starting out on his journey with a
sleigh overladen with toys. How life-like the
reindeer looked, to be sure! and how impatient
to be off!</p>
<p>“They can go, I bet you!” shouted Georgie,
“once Santa takes up the lines.”</p>
<p>Next followed a scene among the roof-tops; a
great round moon overhead, and Santa Claus
already disappearing down the chimney.</p>
<p>“This can be your house, John,” says Robin,
magnanimously. “Perhaps he’s going to leave
that tin trumpet. I don’t want it.”</p>
<p>“Neither do I,” answered John. “I’d rather
have a real automobile.”</p>
<p>But already the scene had shifted. Santa
Claus, upon the hearthrug, was filling stockings
with a roguish glance at three little heads buried
among the pillows of a great four-poster bed.</p>
<p>How the children laughed and applauded!
Next came the stories of <i>Cinderella, Puss in
Boots</i>, and <i>Hop o’ My Thumb</i>, which were an
almost equal success; and, finally, when the last
slide was exhausted, the lights were turned up,
and what Georgie called “the real party” was
brought in. This consisted of ice cream, served
in pretty coloured forms of fruits and flowers;
lady-fingers; dishes of sugar-plums, and a mild
brew of cocoa.</p>
<p>The favours were mechanical toys, such as
are sold in quantities along Broadway and
Twenty-third Street at this season of the year,—something
amusing or interesting for each one.
Georgie had a monkey that ran up a stick; Robin
a small toy balloon in the shape of a pink rubber
pig, that squealed shrilly when blown up; Geof a
rooster that could flap its wings and crow; and
Ernie a little old woman with a rake and a
watering-pot, who, after being properly wound
up, would start conscientiously forth to sprinkle
her garden, only to trip at the first obstruction
she met, and lie kicking her heels frantically on
the carpet.</p>
<p>“Oh, it has been a <i>love-ly</i> party,” sighed Robin,
at last, his arms tight about Mrs. Burroughs’
neck, as he kissed her a sticky but affectionate
good-bye. “Thank you <i>so</i> much, and Merry
Christmas, dear!”</p>
<p>“God bless you, darling boy,” returned Mrs.
Burroughs. “Promise you won’t lie awake
thinking about it, and to-morrow will come all
the sooner.”</p>
<p>So, with season’s greetings, and many protestations
of having passed a most delightful evening,
the guests departed. Robin was hustled upstairs
to bed by mother; while Ernie, Haze, and I proceeded
to collect the various Christmas gifts that
had arrived, preparatory to filling his stocking.</p>
<p>Really, there was so much! A delightful
swan’s-down comforter for his cot from Aunt
Adelaide; a set of building-blocks from Georgie;
the <i>Jungle Books</i> from Mrs. Burroughs; and a
regiment of tin-soldiers, with artillery and
mounted officers, that had come in the morning’s
mail from Miss Brown. Next we brought out
the home things;—a gay little dressing-gown that
mother had made from her old cashmere shawl
with cherry-colour collar and cuffs; a pair of
crocheted slippers to match, this was my gift; a
little white flannel rabbit, with pink beads for
eyes and a fluff of a tail, from Ernie, and a really
amazing menagerie, of some hundred and fifty
animals, elephants, giraffes, lions, tigers, leopards,
monkeys, and all. She had traced the
pictures from old magazines, transferred the outline
to heavy paper, cut the figures out and
coloured them.</p>
<p>“They’re wonderful, Ernie!” I cried.</p>
<p>“But where’s my present?” asked Haze, looking
worried.</p>
<p>“It’s coming,” says Ernie. And, running
from the room, she returned a moment later
with—what do you think? Nothing more nor
less than a <i>clam</i>! a live clam, if you please, neatly
housed in the little glass globe that Hazard used
to keep gold-fish in some years ago.</p>
<p>“Holy smoke!” muttered Haze, not knowing
whether to be most disappointed or amused.
“Wh-what’s it for?”</p>
<p>“A pet, to be sure!” answered Ernie, nonchalantly.
“I bought it of Murray, the fishman,
and, though he said he did not usually sell clams
by the piece, when he did they cost just one cent.
So we’ll call it Abraham Lincoln in memory of
your lucky penny. Bobsie will love it! It can
snap at a straw if you try to tickle it, and hang on
like a bulldog. You’ll see.”</p>
<p>“But how did you ever come to think of it,
Ernie?” I asked.</p>
<p>“Clam-fritters,” answered Ernie, succinctly.
“We had ’em the other morning for breakfast,
and then, too, we’ve been studying bivalves in
school this term, and they are really very interesting
animals.”</p>
<p>So, the stocking was filled, with an orange, an
apple, the molasses-candy figures,—chicken, pig,
boy,—some sugar-plums left over from the party,
my slippers, and the white flannel rabbit, whose
pink silesia ears poked alluringly out at the top.
Mother and I stole on tiptoe into the nursery to
play the part of Santa Claus, by light of a shaded
candle. We dropped the down quilt softly over
Robin’s crib, and stood for a moment watching
our baby, who, quite worn out with the evening’s
excitement, slept feverishly, a bright flush upon
his cheek, his little breast rising and falling in
answer to his hurried breathing.</p>
<p>“I hope it has not been too much for him,” said
mother, in a low voice.</p>
<p>“I hope not,” I answered.</p>
<p>But we might have spared ourselves anxiety.
Robin slept quietly through the night, and till
half-past seven Christmas morning, when he
woke as fresh and blithe as a lark. And how delighted
he was with all his things! He positively
shouted with joy over the paper menagerie and
tin soldiers; and insisted upon being put into his
new dressing-gown on the spot, with many sarcastic
side remarks about “boys what said there
was no Santa Claus!”</p>
<p>But the present that pleased him most of all
was—Abraham Lincoln!</p>
<p>“It is what I wanted more than <i>anything in
the world</i>!” he remarked, with a fondly doting
glance at his new pet. “Only I didn’t think of
it in time to say so. Now when Rosebud runs
away and leaves me, I need never be lonely
again!”</p>
<p>Though the rest of us did not fare as royally
as Robin, there was some trifle for each one;—Ernie
had seen to that.</p>
<p>“I had just fifty cents to spend on the entire
family,” she explained. “Don’t you think I
managed well?”</p>
<p>There were also a number of pretty gifts from
Mrs. Burroughs, the score of <i>Robin Hood</i> from
Meta for me, and a really portentous jackknife
with three blades and a corkscrew attachment
from Geof for Ernie.</p>
<p>“How jolly!” she cried, hopping about on her
little pink toes. “I need never borrow Hazard’s
again, and I can pull all Robin’s cod-liver oil
corks! Hurr-oo!”</p>
<p>After breakfast came church. Haze volunteered
to stay with Bobsie, so that mother, Ernie,
and I might go. But just as we were leaving the
house whom should we meet on the front stoop
but Geoffrey, bearing his much-heralded present
for Robin,—a really handsome nickel-plated cage
in which crouched a pair of tiny white mice!</p>
<p>“The darlings!” chortled Ernie. “I can’t leave
’em! I can’t!”</p>
<p>So she deserted mother and me, and followed
Geof to the nursery. And when we returned
from service some two hours later, the three enthusiasts
were still gloating.</p>
<p>“Look, Elizabeth!” exulted Ernie. “We’ve let
’em out of the cage, and they are quite tame!”</p>
<p>“I’m going to call them Open, O Buds, O
Open, and Sweet Fern,” remarked Robin, in sentimental
accents. “Nobody helped me think of
those names. Aren’t they pretty?”</p>
<p>“See, Aunt Peggy,” says Geof. “There’s a
wheel to the cage, so they can get plenty of exercise,
and the man I bought ’em of told me we
might expect a family about every three weeks.”</p>
<p>“Dear me!” murmured mother, in some dismay.
“I wish he hadn’t been quite so lavish in
his promises. But I must go down to attend to
dinner now. Be careful of Rosebud, Robin.
She would like your mice only too well, I
fear.”</p>
<p>The afternoon passed quietly, Ernie and Haze
carrying our usual Christmas package to the little
Kerns, whose mother used to wash for us, once
on a time. She is an invalid, now, and the family
are even poorer than we, poor lambs!</p>
<p>“So whatever we may have to go without ourselves,
we can’t afford to economise on Luella,
Joseph, and Angeline,” remarked Ernie some two
or three weeks ago. And immediately she and
Robin set to work patching up their dilapidated
toys and picture books, generously casting aside
those that were “too shabby,” clipping, stitching,
and gluing, till “the Kern shelf” in the nursery
cupboard presented a very attractive appearance,
indeed.</p>
<p>Mother added oranges, a jar of beef extract,
and half a pound of tea.</p>
<p>“I do hope they will like their things as well
as we like ours,” sighed Robin responsibly, stuffing
his molasses candy pig and the last of the
sugar plums into Haze’s overcoat pocket. “Do
you think they will, mother dear?”</p>
<p>“I don’t see why they should not,” mother answered,
and then she took Robin in her lap in the
big rocker, and read him the Christmas story
from St. Matthew, explaining about the Wise
Men and the gifts they brought. After which
she lowered the nursery shades, and left him to
take a nap, “because,” she explained, “I want our
boy to be fresh and rested for this evening.”</p>
<p>“What?” I asked. “More surprises?”</p>
<p>“Just a little one,” returned mother, modestly.</p>
<p>Yet it turned out to be the most charming of
all. You would never guess! A tiny toy Christmas
tree, not more than a foot and a half high,
lighted with twelve little candles, and gay with
popcorn wreaths, gilded walnuts, and silver
tinsel.</p>
<p>“I found it on the Bowery,” explained mother,
half guiltily,—“in a small German shop. It was
very cheap, Elizabeth. So don’t worry!”</p>
<p>How Robin’s eyes shone as he was carried into
the back parlour, where the little tree stood sparkling
on a table drawn up beside the couch!</p>
<p>“There are presents on it, too,” says mother.</p>
<p>And so there were! For from every branch
and twig dangled a series of coloured pasteboard
discs, lettered in white ink, and reading thus:—</p>
<p>“A pearl ring, with much love to Elizabeth
from mother.”</p>
<p>“A pair of skates, for dear Ernie from mother.”</p>
<p>“Lockhart’s <i>Life of Scott</i>,—three volumes,
good type,—for Hazard from mother.”</p>
<p>“A canary in a gold cage, for Robin from
mother.”</p>
<p>“An ermine muff and stole, for Elizabeth from
mother,” etc., etc.</p>
<p>All the dear, beautiful, dream gifts that mother
would have given to her children, if only she had
been able!</p>
<p>The candles on the little tree began to blink and
twinkle like living stars, the way lights will when
looked at through happy tears. Even Robin understood.</p>
<p>“I love my autoharp better than anything in
the world,” he declared, dangling the small pasteboard
disc by its red cord. “Even, even, better
than Abraham Lincoln!” he cried. “Thank you
<i>so much</i>, mother dear!”</p>
<p>“And that Lockhart’s <i>Life</i>!” echoed Haze, as
enthusiastically as if he expected to sit down to
the first volume next minute. “<i>U-m-m!!</i>”</p>
<p>“I hope I have not only succeeded in making
you dissatisfied, my poor lambs,” said mother, a
little anxiously.</p>
<p>“Dissatisfied!” cried Ernie, striking out in fine
skating style for the piano. “Do you think it’s
a brood of ungrateful brutes you’ve hatched into
the wor-rld, mum? Let’s have some carols now.
I want to shout!”</p>
<p>And so we did! Hazard quite off the tune, as
usual, Robin piping away in his gay little treble,
Ernie and I trying our best to keep the others up
to time.</p>
<p>It was all very jolly; and, as I said when I first
sat down to write, we simply could not have
passed a lovelier Christmas, no matter how much
money we might have spent,—now do you think
we could?</p>

<h2 class='mt2em mb1em fs1r0em chapter'>Thursday, January 1.</h2>
</div></div>
<p class='ti0'>We sat up last night to watch the New Year
in,—Haze, Geof, Ernie, and I. The
workshop was cold, and we missed the flying-machine.</p>
<p>“I do not believe,” declared Ernie, dejectedly,
“that Resolutions do a bit of good. I have made
the same four regularly for the last two years.
I’ve written them out in red ink on a slip of paper,
and kept them in my Bible;—and nobody seems to
find me any nicer!”</p>
<p>“Perhaps they were not the right kind,” hazarded
Geof. “A good deal depends upon what
one resolves, I suppose.”</p>
<p>“The idea!” flashed Ernie. “I guess you did
not make any better;—say my prayers, wash
my teeth, love God, and the Boarders, so
there!”</p>
<p>“Too general,” criticised Haze. “You ought
to do those things whether you resolve them or
not,—and it wouldn’t be especially annoying even
if you didn’t. It is my opinion that no man is
competent to make his own resolutions. He
doesn’t know where he most needs reform. If
one’s family made them for one, now, and one
was pledged in advance——”</p>
<p>“All right,” agreed Geof. “Let’s try it. I resolve,
old chap, that you hold up your head when
you walk, and quit peering through your glasses
like a Reuben at a County fair.”</p>
<p>“And take only one butter-ball at dinner,” seconded
Ernie.</p>
<p>“And brush your coat every morning. If one
isn’t handsome, one can at least be neat,” I cried.</p>
<p>“I’ll see myself hanged,” retorted Hazard,
angrily, “before I resolve one of those things!
They are childish, as well as insulting. If this
meeting is going to degenerate into a travesty, I
withdraw.” And he stalked haughtily from the
room.</p>
<p>“Silly chap!” chuckled Geof. “What did he
get mad at?”</p>
<p>“Haze must be very conceited, if he can’t stand
a little friendly criticism,” agreed Ernie. “Shall
we take Elizabeth next?”</p>
<p>“No,” I amended hastily. “I have just
thought of such a good one for you, Ernie dear.
Don’t wear stockings with Jacob’s ladders running
up the leg. It isn’t ladylike, and you have
plenty of time to darn them.”</p>
<p>“And stop worrying about the shape of your
nose,” added Geof. “You can’t change it, you
know.”</p>
<p>“I don’t worry,” snapped Ernie, untruthfully.
“You are a pig, Geoffrey Graham! And I resolve
that you learn to dance, so there!”</p>
<p>“Shan’t do it,” said Geof, with whom dancing
is still a sore subject. “And if you are going to
call names, I think it is about time for me to go
home.”</p>
<p>“Good-night,” consented Ernie, readily.</p>
<p>“Good-night,” returned Geof. And he picked
up his cap, and left.</p>
<p>“Dear me!” I remarked as the first horn
sounded, and the bells began to chime their welcome
to the New Year;—“what made everybody
so cross to-night? I am the only person who did
not get mad.”</p>
<p>“You are the only person who did not have a
resolution made for you,” replied Ernie. “Here
is one,—and you can just see how you like it!
Stop being so everlastingly ready to preach, Elizabeth.
I know you call it ‘sympathy,’ but it bores
people.”</p>
<p>“Oh, Ernie!” I gasped. “Do you really mean
that?”</p>
<p>“Well, perhaps not entirely,” admitted Ernie,
with a swift return to normal lovableness. “But
there is some truth in it, dear. One likes to be
blue at times, and feel that it isn’t noticed. Come
along to bed. I’m sorry I let Geof go without saying
‘Happy New Year,’ and I’m sorry we forgot
to eat the Italian chestnuts he brought. After
all, the old way of making resolutions was best.”</p>
<p>“Yes,” I agreed, “and pleasanter, by far!”</p>
<p>Then we kissed one another, and laughed, and
crept down the attic stairs hand in hand;—for it
isn’t often that Ernie and I come near a quarrel,
and the New Year was in. I wonder what it
will bring us? Oh, I do want to be good,—resolutions
apart,—not “preachy,” of course,—just
stronger, and more contented and happy in
our lot.</p>
</div>
<div class='chapter' id='d0105'>
<div class='rb-container'><div class='rb'>
<h2 class='mt2em mb1em fs1r0em chapter'>Monday, January 5.</h2>
</div></div>
<p class='ti0'>Ernie wore her new dress to school this
morning. She has been working hard on
it ever since Christmas time, and the result is
really very creditable.</p>
<p>“The girls will never believe I made it myself,
Elizabeth,” she remarked, standing proudly before
the mirror while I buttoned her up the back.
“It actually <i>fits</i>, and look at these box-pleats!
Could anything be more stylish! Don’t you
think I’m clever, honey? now, <i>don’t</i> you?”</p>
<p>Indeed, Ernie’s spirits rose to such bubbling
point,—what with the openly expressed admiration
of the girls, and her own inward conviction
of merit,—that she found it impossible to keep
them corked up during school hours, and so got
into trouble, poor child!</p>
<p>Under the circumstances it is doubly hard.
For ever since September, when a “Visiting
Board,” as Ernie persists in calling him, was so
impressed with the intelligent answers he obtained
to his questions in the Sixth Grammar
Grade of School No. 47 that he was moved to
offer five dollars’ worth of books to be awarded
as a prize at the end of the term to the pupil whose
general average in attendance, conduct, and
scholarship should be highest, her record has been
impeccable.</p>
<p>“I simply must come out ahead,” she has declared,
over and over again. “It is too good a
chance to miss. Five dollars’ worth of books,
Elizabeth! Think of it! And if I should get
’em, I’ll choose the kind that will be appropriate
to every age and gender, and then I’ll put ’em
away, and give them as birthday presents
to the family during the year. Isn’t that a
scheme?”</p>
<p>So, spurred on by this proud ambition, Ernie
has done wonderfully:—even succeeding in subduing
her mercurial temperament to such a degree
that “there is not a betther gur-rul in all the
school than me an’ me hated rival, Lulu Jennings,”
as she was moved to confess last Saturday
night.</p>
<p>This aforesaid rival is a “creature,” according
to Ernie and her chum, Mary Hobart. She has
shifty little eyes, a thin, blond pigtail, and “<i>no
shape</i> to her legs, at all.” Also, she smells of
cheap perfume. Yet these imperfections might
be forgiven her, if only she were what the girls
call “straight.”</p>
<p>“I’ve seen her myself,” says downright Mary,
“with an open Geography hid under a handkerchief
in her lap during recitation. She tattles,
too, and I believe she’d copy off her own grandmother,
if only she got the chance.”</p>
<p>Naturally such sins are not easily forgiven; and
there is a decided opinion among the girls that
at all hazards Lulu Jennings must be prevented
from winning the prize. Feeling runs high on
the subject. “She’s smarter than all the rest of
us put together in some ways,” they admit.
“You can never foresee what trick she is going to
play next. But you are clever, too, Ernie, in a
way we like better. So keep up the good fight!”</p>
<p>“All right,” promised Ernie, with a weary little
sigh. “I don’t mind the studying so much;
but I must confess I’m tired of being a plaster
saint!”</p>
<p>And, alas! to-day, which was composition day,
the poor little plaster saint fell! It happened in
this wise. The subject assigned the Sixth Grade
was Benjamin Franklin. Ernie, who takes
naturally to writing, finished her essay as usual
before any of the other girls; and then, just for
the fun of the thing, and as an outlet, I suppose,
to the general ebullition of vivacity caused by her
new frock, she started in to write a second theme,
in verse this time, making it as nonsensical and
ridiculous as ever she could.</p>
<p>As soon as finished, she passed the lines to
Mary Hobart, her seatmate, who began to read
and giggle at the same moment,—till finally she
was so overcome by mirth that she was obliged
to put her head into her desk, and pretend to look
for a slate pencil.</p>
<p>Lulu Jennings, who sits directly across the
aisle from Mary, observed these demonstrations.
“What’s the matter?” she whispered.</p>
<p>And Mary thoughtlessly passed her Ernie’s
effusion;—proud, I suppose, to prove to the
enemy how clever her chum really was.</p>
<p>Lulu cast one quick glance down the lines.
Then, taking up a pencil, she scrawled the query
along the margin,—“Why don’t you ask to read
it aloud?” And handed the paper back to Ernie.</p>
<p>“I will, if you like,” returned Ernie with a
chuckle; supposing, of course, that the suggestion
was only part of the fun.</p>
<p>“All right, I dare you to,” whispered Lulu.</p>
<p>Quick as a flash Ernie was out of her seat.
She has never been known to take a dare, yet;
and Lulu counted upon this weakness, we feel
sure.</p>
<p>“May I read my composition, Miss Horton?”
asked Ernie. There was nothing unusual in the
request, since any girl who considers her theme
extra-good is accorded this privilege.</p>
<p>Miss Horton looked up from the exercises she
was correcting.</p>
<p>“Certainly, if you think it will interest us,
Ernestine,” she said.</p>
<p>Mary Hobart pulled at Ernie’s skirt, shook her
head, and motioned imperiously to the first composition
which still lay upon the desk.</p>
<p>But Lulu’s little eyes flashed the mean message,—“I
knew you would not dare!”</p>
<p>And, without a moment’s hesitation, Ernie in
a clear, serious voice began to read:</p>
<div class='c'>
<div class='mb1em mt1em'>BENJAMIN FRANKLIN.</div>
</div>
<div class='cb-container'><div class='cb'>
<div>Benjamin Franklin was, when a boy,</div>
<div>His mother’s delight, and his grandmother’s joy;</div>
<div>He would chase after lightning wherever he spied it,</div>
<div>Because he declared that he wanted to ride it.</div>
<div>His hair was quite straight, but his nose he could curl,</div>
<div>And so people thought him “a dear little girl!”</div>
</div></div>
<p>There was a general shout from the class, while
Miss Horton rapped sharply on the desk with her
ruler:—</p>
<p>“Silence!” she commanded. “Proceed with
your composition, Ernestine.”</p>
<p>And Ernie, with a rosy and rather abashed
countenance, was about to begin the second
stanza when the door opened and Miss O’Connell,
the principal, entered the room. Miss O’Connell
is a very imposing person, and endowed with a
rather high temper. All the girls are afraid of
her. She stood for a moment looking majestically
about.</p>
<p>“What was the cause of the outburst of disorder
I heard just now?” she finally asked Miss
Horton.</p>
<p>“Ernestine Graham is reading her composition
on Benjamin Franklin,” answered Miss Horton,
really anxious to shield Ernie, it would seem.
“There was something in it that struck the girls
as funny.”</p>
<p>“So I should judge,” answered Miss O’Connell.
“It might be well for me to hear the rest of
the composition myself. You may proceed,
Ernestine.”</p>
<p>Poor Ernie! her knees were literally clapping
together with horror beneath the elegant box-pleats
of her new plaid skirt. The thought of
her cherished record assailed her. She turned a
piteous, sickly smile upon Miss O’Connell, who
met it with a glance of adamant. Evidently no
quarter was to be expected from that direction.
So, steadying her voice as well as she could,
Ernie began to read again. This time you might
have heard a pin drop:—</p>
<div class='cb-container'><div class='cb'>
<div>Benjamin’s father, a terrible man,</div>
<div>Kept in the closet a worn rattan;</div>
<div>When Ben or his brothers did what was wrong,</div>
<div>Their father would chant them this horrible song:—</div>
<div>“Run, run, to my closet as quick as you can,</div>
<div>And bring me my rat-te-tee, tat-te-tee, tan!</div>
<div>And with it I’ll rat-te-tee, tat-tee-tan you,</div>
<div>Until with your eyeses you crieses, boo-hoo!”</div>
</div></div>
<p>Ernie gasped for breath.</p>
<p>“Is that all?” asked the inexorable Miss
O’Connell.</p>
<p>“No, ma’am,” answered Ernie, plaintively;
and spurred on by the recklessness of despair, she
began the last stanza:—</p>
<div class='cb-container'><div class='cb'>
<div>So Ben and his brothers they grew very good,</div>
<div>They never stole nothing, not even their food!</div>
<div>But lived upon pickles, and peanuts, and paint,</div>
<div>And when asked, “Are you hungry?” replied, “No, we ain’t;</div>
<div>But we’ll take, if you’ll give it, a wee bite of soap!”</div>
<div>And now they’re all dead, and in heaven, I hope.</div>
</div></div>
<p>With a final, hysterical giggle, Ernie dropped
back into her seat.</p>
<p>Miss O’Connell stood looking at her.</p>
<p>“What possessed you,” she asked at last, “to
write such a composition as that? Have you no
respect for your teacher? have you no respect for
your school? have you no respect for <i>me</i>? Miss
Horton, you may mark Ernestine a failure in her
conduct and her English, too. She will remain
after school, and rewrite her composition along
<i>more conservative</i> lines. The class may now
proceed with its studies.” And Miss O’Connell
swept from the room.</p>
<p>Well, Ernie had had her little joke. Poor
child! it was all she could do to blink back the
mortified tears as she felt Mary Hobart’s sympathetic
hand in hers, and divined instinctively that
the thoughts of every girl in the room were busy
with her shattered record.</p>
<p>“I am sorry, Ernestine,” said Miss Horton not
unkindly, as she took up her pencil and opened
the portentous covers of the Conduct Book.
“Do you really think it was worth while?”</p>
<p>Lulu Jennings snickered; but quickly recovered
herself with a prim pursing of the lips.
Apparently, she was the one person in the room
to experience any touch of satisfaction in the public
downfall of “the plaster saint.” Which
speaks pretty well for Ernie’s popularity, it seems
to me.</p>
<p>“The mean <i>sneak</i>!” declared Mary Hobart
indignantly, some half-hour later, to the little
group of sympathisers who lingered in the schoolyard
till Ernie should be released. “It was all a
plot! And to think that I should have helped to
lead Ernie into it! Well, I’m more determined
than ever that she shall win the prize. We
mustn’t let her feel too discouraged, girls! we
mustn’t! The poor, silly darling!”</p>
<p>And now, lest you mistake me for a wizard,
I will confess that Mary came home with Ernie
after school. The two girls talked the excitement
over as they set the table for dinner, while
I stood in the kitchen doorway and listened,
potato-knife in hand, till I felt quite as if I had
witnessed it all myself,—and so I have set it
down here, though it is hard to snatch time on
a Monday.</p>

</div></div>
<p class='ti0'>You haven’t any idea how poor we are. It
is half funny and half terrible,—trying to
keep house for a family of six people on seven
dollars a week! Just at first it did not seem impossible.
There was a false impetus, so to speak;
coal in the cellar, coffee, oatmeal, flour, etc., in
the kitchen cupboard. For a while we were even
able to keep up a semblance of our usual table,
and Miss Brown did not seem to suspect.
But she must find out soon. Will she leave
us when she knows? What shall we do,
if she does? Each meal is a crisis. I grow
quite white and shaky before sounding the
bell.</p>
<p>Mother still refuses to draw anything from
the bank, and we can’t borrow of Uncle George,
either; because he was so hateful after the Hancocks
left, and said things about father that it
will be hard to forgive. If we had Haze’s salary,
we might advertise the rooms more often;—but,
as things stand, it is impossible, on account
of that dreadful dollar.</p>
<p>Why did he have to lose so much money,—dear
Haze,—when he had made such sacrifices to
earn something, just for us? Why did Mrs.
Hudson have to go, and the Hancocks, too? Oh,
I do try to be brave; but to-night I feel rebellious,—and
worried! I don’t dare go to bed, though
Ernie has been asleep this last half-hour. I wish
I were more like her,—hopeful and full of expedients.</p>
<p>“The one thing that will do this family any
good,” she remarked the other morning, as she
stood in the dining-room window waiting for the
postman to come down the block,—“is a legacy.
I have given up all hope of the Dump-Cart
Contract. It simply can’t be found. But why
shouldn’t a rich relation, of whom we’ve never
heard, die and leave us his wealth? Such things
have been known to happen.”</p>
<p>And now, absurdly, we are all expecting it!
Even mother starts at the sound of the familiar
whistle, and some one of us rushes breathless to
the door to glower through the letters that are
handed in. Heaven knows why!—for we haven’t
any rich relation except Uncle George. I suppose
it just shows how desperate we are.</p>
<p>Saturday is pay-day, and we younger ones have
acquired the habit of gulping our breakfast on
that particular morning, and leaving the table as
expeditiously as possible; so as to give Miss
Brown, who is very delicate where money
matters are concerned, an early opportunity to
settle.</p>
<p>“Will she do it? will she say she is going to
leave?” we whisper anxiously to one another, as
we hang over the basement banisters. And Haze
can’t make up his mind to go downtown till he
knows.</p>
<p>Yesterday morning we had a dreadful fright.
Miss Brown came down a little late. Her expression
was troubled, almost severe. When she
put her pocket handkerchief into her lap, we made
sure that her purse was not concealed, as usual,
among the folds.</p>
<p>“May I be excused, mother dear?” piped
Ernie,—though she had only just begun her
oaten-meal. “I want to go up to the nursery and
sit with Robin.”</p>
<p>Haze and I followed as quickly as we could,
and then the waiting began. It seemed as if
mother and Miss Brown would never be done.
We could hear their voices in low, earnest discussion.</p>
<p>“Gosh!” exclaimed Hazard. “The game is
up.”</p>
<p>But it wasn’t. Miss Brown had had facial
neuralgia during the night. She was asking
mother for remedies. She could not make up
her mind whether it would be wise to put off the
shopping trip that she had planned. Her purse
was with her as usual. Saved again!</p>
<p>And the funny thing is, once we get those seven
dollars, we feel quite rich for a few hours, mother
and I.—</p>
<p>“What shall we have for to-morrow morning’s
breakfast?” one asks the other magnificently. “I
notice that grape-fruit are selling two for twenty-five
cents.”</p>
<p>“Scallops would make a nice change,” comes
the cheerful reply. “Grape-fruit, scallops, and
corn-muffins!”</p>
<p>Not that we ever commit ourselves to any such
extravagance; but the little flight is exhilarating,
and the final compromise on oranges and fish-cakes
not too abrupt. It is true,—we are fed
from day to day like the sparrows. If we can
only wait and have patience, I suppose things will
come out right in the end. And I said that I
wanted to be good this year. Well, I believe I
could be on ten dollars more a week.</p>

<h2 class='mt2em mb1em fs1r0em chapter'>Friday, January 16.</h2>
</div></div>
<p class='ti0'>This afternoon a lady called to look at rooms.</p>
<p>She had a little girl with her, perhaps a
couple of years older than Robin. She said that
she had been recommended to us,—by Mrs. Hudson!</p>
<p>Ernie let them in, and galloped upstairs to tell
mother. You can imagine our excitement.</p>
<p>“Hush!” whispered Ernie, as she and I
crouched behind the half-closed nursery door,
listening with all our ears. “She told me the location
was what she wanted. Oh, Elizabeth!
Elizabeth!”</p>
<p>At that moment the lady swept on her way
downstairs.</p>
<p>“The terms seem reasonable enough,” we heard
her observe, “and the room is sunny and pleasant.
I should want a comfortable cot placed in it for
Lilian,”—the little girl. “You have children of
your own, Mrs. Graham?” Then, stopping in
the lower hall,—</p>
<p>“Is that an invalid chair?” she asked, abruptly.</p>
<p>“Yes,” returned mother. “It belongs to my
little son;—he is not at all well this winter.”</p>
<p>“And his trouble?” There was no hint of
sympathy in the question.</p>
<p>“Hip complaint,” replied mother. “Robin has
not been strong since he was a baby.”</p>
<p>“In that case, I am sorry, but it will be impossible
to engage the room,” came the unexpected
reply. “Lilian is a very sensitive child,—and,
naturally, my first consideration. I make it a
rule to shield her from every depressing influence.
Let me see,—there are three other places on our
list. If we hurry, we can make time to visit
them this afternoon. Good-day, Mrs. Graham.”
The door closed sharply on our prospective
boarders.</p>
<p>And this on a Friday,—the bluest day in the
week!</p>
<p>Mother’s face was quite white and stern as she
came upstairs.</p>
<p>“If you will get dinner, Elizabeth, I’ll stay
with Robin,” she said. And she took Bobsie in
her arms, and carried him tenderly to the big
rocker in the window, while Ernie and I crept,
mouse-like, from the room.</p>
<p>“One might have known she was a friend of
Mrs. Hudson,” remarked Ernie, vindictively, as
we reached the foot of the basement stairs. “Depressing
influence, indeed! I’d like to depress
her precious Lilian for her!”</p>
<p>“Oh, Ernie,” I sighed. “It would have meant
fifteen dollars more each week!”</p>
<p>We were to have beefsteak for dinner. Mother
had gone around earlier in the afternoon to a
cheap little butcher shop (we can’t afford our old
tradesmen any longer), and bought two pounds,—spending
our last forty cents. There were
four potatoes in the oven, a few beans on the top
of the stove,—but no bread.</p>
<p>“Mother shan’t be disturbed,” I cried. “I’ll
run around to the baker’s, myself, and get a loaf.
I’ll say that I left my purse at home (which will
be perfectly true, and, under the circumstances,
eminently sensible!) and that they can charge it.
Keep an eye on the steak, Ernie, and the fire.
I’ve just put on a couple of sticks of wood.”</p>
<p>“All right,” answered Ernie, from where she
sat on the table, dejectedly swinging her legs and
muttering over an open Geography. “I’ll watch
it.”</p>
<p>Yet when I returned from my errand some few
moments later it was to find the kitchen full of
smoke. In the middle of the floor pranced Ernie,
frantically blowing upon a smutty and spluttering
gridiron, while the red flames leapt hungrily
through the open top of the stove.</p>
<p>“What have you <i>done</i>?” I cried, snatching the
gridiron from Ernie’s blackened fingers. “That
steak is burned to a cinder! It’s Friday night.
There isn’t any more money. Do you realise
what this means?”</p>
<p>“Oh dear! oh dear! I was bounding the British
Isles!” wailed Ernie. “And the fire didn’t
come up,—till all of a sudden everything began to
blaze! Of course, I realise, Elizabeth. Can’t
we scrape it, or something?”</p>
<p>“No,” I answered, transferring the hopelessly
charred bit of steak to the big blue platter. “It
is burned quite through,—and to-morrow is Saturday.
How can we expect Miss Brown to keep
on paying seven dollars a week,—once she finds
out that we are unable to feed her?”</p>
<p>“Then chop off my head and boil it for her old
dinner,” sobbed Ernie, entirely overcome by this
last, unlooked-for disaster, for which she could
not but hold herself responsible. “Nobody’d
miss it,—about the house, I mean,—and they used
to eat such things once,—in the British Isles!”</p>
<p>“What is the matter?” asked mother, entering
the kitchen at this moment with Robin’s tray, and
looking from one tragic-faced daughter to the
other. “Has anything new happened?”</p>
<p>“The steak is burned,” I explained, briefly.
“There are only beans and four potatoes left for
dinner.”</p>
<p>“Chop off my head,” reiterated poor little
Ernie. “I deserve it. I was bounding the British
Isles,—and forgot to watch. I wish, I <i>wish</i>
that I’d never been born!”</p>
<p>And then it was that mother “rose,” buoyantly,
unexpectedly, as she can always be depended upon
doing, if only the situation is desperate enough.</p>
<p>“Never mind, darlings,” she cried, with an
airy little laugh. “Why,—it’s nothing but a
beefsteak, after all. We’ll buy another!”</p>
<p>“<i>Another!</i>” I gasped, as if mother were contemplating
the purchase of a diamond tiara.</p>
<p>“<i>Another!</i>” wondered Ernie.</p>
<p>“Certainly,” returned mother, quite as though
it were the most natural thing in the world she
was proposing. “And some pickles, because Miss
Brown enjoys them,—and perhaps some chocolate
creams!”</p>
<p>“But, mother,” I remonstrated. “It’s Friday
night! We have spent our last penny. You
surely are not going to borrow of Uncle George,—after
the things he’s said!”</p>
<p>“No,” denied mother, succinctly. “There can
be no compromise on that score. On the contrary,
we’ll reap a little belated benefit from one
of dear father’s follies.”</p>
<p>And she led the way to the library (Ernie and I
following in a state of stunned but admiring bewilderment),
and selected a large, handsomely
bound volume from the lowest shelf of the old
mahogany bookcase:—</p>
<p>“It is <i>Picturesque Europe</i>,” mother explained.
“And your father paid six dollars for it, because
the agent was a young widow with pathetic blue
eyes, who assured him it would be of invaluable
assistance in broadening Hazard’s mind. Haze
was two years old at the time, and nobody has
read it since;—but it is going to be of some use,
at last, and help us to another dinner!”</p>
<p>So she and Ernie hustled into their things,
and hurried around the block to the little second-hand
bookshop where father used to snoop in
happy by-gone days;—and when they returned
Ernie was quite beaming and rosy again; for
they brought three pounds of steak with them, instead
of two, as well as a jar of pickles, and a
pound of chocolate creams,—which last was nothing
more nor less than a blatant extravagance,
and put us all into uproarious spirits for the rest
of the evening. And though Mrs. Hudson’s
friend was certainly <i>horrid</i>, and it is hard to be
so poor that the singeing of a beefsteak threatens
dire calamity,—just think how splendid it is to
have such a wonder of a mother!</p>
<p>Yes, Haze and I are agreed, there are compensations
in every lot.</p>
</div>
<div class='chapter' id='d0121'>
<div class='rb-container'><div class='rb'>
<h2 class='mt2em mb1em fs1r0em chapter'>Wednesday, January 21.</h2>
</div></div>
<p class='ti0'>We have formed ourselves into a secret
society,—Haze, Ernie, and I. It is
called “The Magnanimous Do-Withouts,” and
this is the way it happened:</p>
<p>There is never enough to go round at our table
any more, though the lowest shelf of the old
mahogany bookcase is beginning to show some
quite distressing gaps, and naturally Miss Brown
has to be helped first and most liberally to everything.
What she does not get is just about
enough for three,—and, unfortunately, there are
five of us.</p>
<p>“It wouldn’t make so much difference,” complained
Ernie the other evening, “if only things
could be managed with a little more fairness and
system. I look fat, I know; but that does not
prevent my growing hungry, and I’m tired of
pretending that I have no appetite, and being
threatened with Robin’s tonic! Good gracious,—I’d
like to know what would happen if mother <i>did</i>
give it to me! I only refused macaroni this
evening because I knew Haze wouldn’t; and if
we both took it, there would be nothing left for
you. Was it very good, Elizabeth?”</p>
<p>“Yes,” I admitted. “It was nice, dear.”</p>
<p>“And filling?” questioned Ernie. “Of course,
I’m sure Haze doesn’t intend to be mean. He
has a cough, and a habit of looking sort of pathetic,
which takes awfully well with mother; but,
all the same, it wouldn’t hurt him to notice, and
deny himself something once a week,—now
would it?”</p>
<p>“You must remember the wretched luncheons
he has, Ernie,” I said.</p>
<p>“But he eats them in St. Paul’s churchyard,”
retorted Ernie. “A very pleasant spot. And
reads the old epitaphs, and goes in to look at the
windows afterward.” Then she poured a little
of Robin’s milk into a saucer for Rosebud, and
set it down on the hearth.</p>
<p>“No,” she soliloquised. “It isn’t fair, and I’m
not going to stand it.”</p>
<p>The following day it happened that we were to
have lamb stew with barley for dinner. It set
on the back of the stove and simmered gently all
the afternoon, while every now and again an
appetising whiff would be wafted to the dull cold
nursery, where Ernie, Mary Hobart, and Robin
were gathered about the sewing table in the window
playing “Old Maid” and “Tommy-Come-Tickle-Me.”
The tip of poor little Ernie’s nose
was quite red, her hands were numb and chilly as
she dealt the cards. She did not feel in the least
convivial. Indeed, she confessed to me later,
that, judging from the symptoms going on inside
her, she supposed she must be starving, and had
only a few hours more to live.</p>
<p>Robin also was restless and inattentive; but
Mary Hobart, having lunched comfortably at
home, thoroughly enjoyed the game.</p>
<p>“Let’s have another deal,” she cried. “I’ve
been Old Maid three times! It’s a shameful
slander, and I shan’t go home till my luck
changes. Cut, Ernie!”</p>
<p>“It’s getting pretty dark,” hinted Ernie, glancing
through the window at the beaconing streetlights.
“Won’t your mother worry?”</p>
<p>“Oh, no,” returned Mary, disappointingly.
“She knows where I am, and expects me to be
late.”</p>
<p>So Robin and Ernie played politely and
hungrily on (that stew did smell so good,—<i>um-m!</i>)
till at last the gong sounded, and Mary
was obliged to go. But even then Ernie must
help her into coat and hat, before she could
scamper down to join the family in the dining-room.</p>
<p>“Will you have a little stew, Hazard dear?”
mother was asking, as Ernie slipped with watchful
eyes into her belated place. I had already
been served. There were probably three spoonfuls
left in the platter. The case was desperate.
Ernie, realising this, leaned tragically over, and
gave one swift, violent kick beneath the table.</p>
<p>There resounded a smothered shriek from Miss
Brown. The warning had miscarried!</p>
<p>“Oh, I beg your pardon!” cries Ernie. “It
was Hazard I <i>meant</i> to kick!”</p>
<p>“What in thunder!” retorted Haze. Then, in
a sudden burst of hurt enlightenment,—“Ernie,
you are a pig! I wasn’t going to take any of
your old stew.”</p>
<p>Mother quietly helped the two combatants,
apologised to Miss Brown for Ernie’s “awkwardness,”
and dined upon dry bread herself. It was
later in the kitchen that we gave Haze a talking
to,—Ernie and I. He was very repentant, said
he really had not noticed the scarcity before (!),
and thought Ernie’s idea of a “system” excellent.
So the society was organised. We are to take
turns saying we do not care for things:—meat,
vegetables, or pudding, as the case may be. But,—would
you believe it?—this noon at luncheon
Miss Brown actually refused a fishcake, remarking
that she believed she was suffering from “a
slight plethora”!</p>
<p>Perhaps she has suspected all along?—perhaps
we need not worry as we do each Saturday morning?
Oh, if this is true, what a <i>trump</i> she has
been! For she talks politics and the latest novel
in the most natural manner in the world, neither
complains nor criticises, and seems quite oblivious
to our many and obvious shortcomings,—the
prim, generous, tactful darling!</p>

<h2 class='mt2em mb1em fs1r0em chapter'>Saturday, January 24.</h2>
</div></div>
<p class='ti0'>We have had to give Rosebud away, and
Ernie and Robin are quite heartbroken.
It was because he drank so much of Robin’s
milk.</p>
<p>“It seems pretty hard to have to regard a kitten
as an extravagance!” muttered Ernie, rebelliously,
as she sat in the coal-scuttle this morning, clasping
Rosebud to an indignant brown gingham
bosom. “Who’s going to tell Bobs, I’d like to
know? It’s all very well for mother to say we
can’t afford it. There are some things that people
<i>ought</i> to afford.”</p>
<p>“He’ll be very happy with Mary Hobart, dear,”
I coaxed. “And you know he is growing up,
and has an enormous appetite; and he won’t even
try to catch mice,—except Robin’s white ones,—and
milk is eight cents a quart! Don’t make it
any harder for mother. She feels it as much as
any of us.”</p>
<p>“Of course, Mary will be delighted,” continued
Ernie, bitterly; “and I’ll have to lie, and say it is
because we want to make her a handsome present.
Chums are pretty disappointing, sometimes,—and
I can’t understand Geof, Elizabeth! A boy
who has three dollars a week pocket-money could
certainly afford to offer to buy a little cat-meat
once in a while. Not that we’d let Geoffrey do
it, of course; but it would be nice to feel that he
wanted to. He used to be so sweet and sympathetic
when I was in trouble; and he hardly seems
to notice, any more. Why,—he’s not been in to
see me for over a week!”</p>
<p>“Perhaps he is busy at school,” I answered.
“I’d be glad to think Geof was really studying in
earnest.”</p>
<p>“Oh, it isn’t that,” returned Ernie. “He has
extra tutoring, I know; but he shirks it whenever
he gets the chance, and slips off to keep some appointment
with that horrid Jim Hollister and
Sam Jacobs. They are not the kind of fellows
he ought to go with.” Then, with a swift return
to the more immediate and poignant woe,—“Dear
Rosebud! dear pussy! It’s too ridiculous,—being
so poor one can’t afford to keep a
kitten!”</p>
<p>That was the part we found next to impossible
to explain to Robin.</p>
<p>“I don’t know what you mean,” he sobbed,
after the first outburst of violent grief was over.
“I like Rosebud to drink my milk, Elizabeth.
It’s good for him.”</p>
<p>“But it’s good for you, too, Bobsie dear,” I
said. “And you are sick, and Rosebud isn’t.
Mother can’t afford to buy more than one quart
a day,—you know that.”</p>
<p>“What’s ‘afford’?” questioned Robin.</p>
<p>“It means that we haven’t the money. We
are poor, dear.”</p>
<p>Robin looked at me out of wondering tear-wet
eyes. “Poor?” he echoed;—“like the people in
stories? Oh, Ellie!”</p>
<p>Then he sighed, and soothed my hand, and was
very sweet and patient all the rest of the afternoon.
He even bade good-bye to Rosebud with
fond stoical precision, patting the kitten on the
head, and remarking: “It is best that we should
part!” Dear, loving, little fellow! I really believe
the information came to him as quite a
shock. But fancy his having to be told!</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<p>When Haze came up from tending the furnace
to-night his face was even more care-lined and
anxious than usual.</p>
<p>“How much is there left?” I asked,—the inevitable
question.</p>
<p>“If we’re careful it may last till the middle of
next week,” returned Hazard, grimly. “Then, I
suppose, we’ll begin pawning the spoons. Odd
world,—hey?”</p>
<p>Certainly, it is hard for Hazey. One can’t
blame him for occasional bitterness. He is working
faithfully and well in uncongenial surroundings,
and has not had a cent of pay for weeks;
while Geof, who is showered with the very advantages
for which Haze so ardently longs, seems
sullenly determined to make no use of them. Oh,
the contrast is cruel! But mother says the
struggle is bringing out a new manliness and self-reliance
in Haze that are a daily surprise and joy
to her. Roses again,—dear mother!</p>
<p>But something had <i>better</i> hurry up and happen
soon!</p>

<div>He thought he saw a Banker’s Clerk</div>
<div>  Descending from the ’bus;</div>
<div>He looked again, and found it was</div>
<div>  A Hippopotamus.</div>
<div>“If this should stay to dine,” he said,</div>
<div>  “There won’t be much for us!”</div>
</div></div>
<p>We did not think it was a Banker’s Clerk, but a
Boarder! Robin, sitting in the wicker rocker in
the window, spied him first.</p>
<p>“Hurrah!” he piped in his shrill little treble.
“I just know that big fat man is coming here!
He is going to ring our door-bell, and engage all
the empty rooms! See, if he doesn’t.”—</p>
<p>And the prophecy came true! It was almost
like the relief of Lucknow.</p>
<div class='cb-container'><div class='cb'>
<div>“All on a sudden the garrison utter a jubilant shout!”</div>
</div></div>
<p>For, oh! I don’t know how much longer we
could have held out.</p>
<p>It was day before yesterday that it happened.
I had wakened with a start in the early, chill, grey
morning, trying dully to remember how many
potatoes still remained in the bottom of the vegetable
box, and whether there was coffee enough to
tide us through the week. It was certain that
the coal would not last. Should we begin pawning
the spoons then,—as Haze predicted,—or,
maybe, mother’s watch?</p>
<p>And, suddenly, it seemed as if life were not
worth living any longer. I did not feel as if I
could get up and make my way, candle in hand,
down the narrow kitchen stairs to an arctic basement,
and a sordid round of housework. It was
Monday, too! The very thought made my back
ache and my head swim;—but mother must not
suspect, because I had persuaded her that the
washing was not too much for me; in fact, that I
rather enjoyed it!</p>
<p>And, to be sure, at the very beginning it had not
seemed so bad. Novelty lent spice. With
the optimism of ignorance I determined that
mind as well as muscles should be exercised.
While scrubbing I would learn French
poetry.</p>
<p>So, with sleeves rolled above the elbow, the
soap-suds splashing in my hot face, I rubbed,
rinsed, and wringered, murmuring the while:—</p>
<div class='cb-container'><div class='cb'>
<div>  O Richard! ô mon roi!</div>
<div>  L’univers t’abandonne;</div>
<div>Sur la terre il n’est donc que moi</div>
<div>Qui s’intéresse à ta personne!</div>
</div></div>
<p class='ti0'>or in more romantic vein,—</p>
<div class='cb-container'><div class='cb'>
<div>L’aube nait et ta porte est close!</div>
<div>Ma belle, pourquoi sommeiller?</div>
<div>A l’heure où s’éveille la rose</div>
<div>Ne vas-tu pas te réveiller?</div>
</div></div>
<p>But this particular morning there was no enthusiasm
left. My brain was dull, my tongue
stumbled and tripped over the most familiar lines,
I could not control my thoughts. Haze had a
cough, and nothing but a sweet potato sandwich
for luncheon,—the struggle was too unfair, too
hopeless!—till, actually, I caught myself weeping
into the washtub, bedewing the family linen with
splashing tears.</p>
<p>Certainly, things did look black. It was over
a month since the Hancocks had left us, nearly
two since we bade farewell to Mrs. Hudson.
Even mother was beginning to show the strain.
She looked worn and worried. As for me, I was
<i>tired</i> of the dish-washing, the sweeping, the dusting;
everything to be done afresh each day. I
had not touched my mandolin for weeks. My
hands, then puffed and scarlet, would be stiff and
cracked on the morrow. I held them up and
looked at them.</p>
<p>Which brought the thought of Meta, and the
old inevitable contrast. That very evening she
was going to a party;—a pretty, informal affair,
consisting of charades, a supper, and a dance.
How care-free her life was! How happily exempt
from sordid considerations! She was surrounded
by attention, gayety, admiration,—<i>I</i>
would love such things, too!</p>
<p>A great fat tear rolled off the tip of my nose,
and splashed down on Robin’s little striped pajamas.</p>
<p>“Come, come,” I told myself. “This is ridiculous!
Cheer up, child, and repeat <i>Horatius</i>, if
you can’t remember any French.”</p>
<p>But even Macaulay’s stirring lines, with which
Haze and I have heartened each other since nursery
days, seemed to have lost their magic.</p>
<div class='cb-container'><div class='cb'>
<div>“Lars Porsena of Clusium,——”</div>
</div></div>
<p>I began; and ended on a sob. Till, quite unexpectedly,
without the least premeditation, I found
myself murmuring instead:—</p>
<div class='blockq'>
<p>“O Lord, raise up, we pray Thee, Thy power, and come
among us, and with great might succour us; that whereas,
through our sins and wickedness, we are sore let and
hindered in running the race that is set before us, Thy
bountiful grace and mercy may speedily help and deliver
us;...”</p>
</div>
<p>It was the beautiful collect for the Fourth
Sunday in Advent. There seemed nothing incongruous
in repeating it above a washtub,
either! Instantly I dried my tears. “Whereas,
through our sins and wickedness, we are sore let
and hindered in running the race that is set before
us!” <i>That</i> was the whole trouble! Parties,
indeed! attention! What did they matter to
a girl blessed with the dearest family in the world
to love and work for? My back stopped aching.
I thought of little patient Robin upstairs in the
big rocker, “pertending” to play with his
“friends,”—how his pale cheeks would flush with
pleasure if I could manage to hang out the clothes
in time to sit with him a few moments before
lunch. It was worth trying for! And so I did;—and
it was that very morning, if you please,
that Bobsie, looking down the street, uttered his
jubilant shout:—</p>
<p>“A Boarder! A Boarder!”</p>
<p>His name is Mr. Lysle. He has a square,
bland face, a portly presence, and a heavy artillery
voice. It was Ernie who dubbed him “the
Hippopotamus.” He has rented our three empty
rooms at the biggest price we have yet received
for them; and he and his wife and his sister will
move in on Saturday! Oh, how beautiful!—that
we should have been so “speedily helped and
delivered.”</p>
<p>“My brave little Elizabeth,” said mother to me
late this evening, “you have been such a comfort,
such a support! But it is over now, dear. We
will send to-morrow for Rose to come back. We
will order furnace coal, and—we <i>haven’t drawn
on our bank account</i>!”</p>
<p>Then she kissed me, and I blushed for very
shame. For I have not been brave,—you know
that, old diary,—at least not <i>inside</i>. How I wish
that I might look back, and honestly feel that I
have earned mother’s precious praise!</p>

<h2 class='mt2em mb1em fs1r0em chapter'>Friday, February 6.</h2>
</div></div>
<p class='ti0'>School politics have been exciting these last
few weeks, though in the stress and strain of
home affairs I have had no time to report them.
But Ernie has taken them very seriously, and for
her sake we are glad the end has come. Yesterday
the Sixth Grammar Grade was promoted,
and the prize-winner’s name read aloud from the
platform. Can you guess who it was?</p>
<p>Let me take the matter up where I dropped it.
Though naturally much discouraged and depressed
by her sudden fall from grace that fatal
composition day, Ernie bravely determined to
retrieve her shattered fortunes. In this resolve
she was supported by Mary Hobart, Hatty
Walker, and a host of other friends.</p>
<p>“It was nothing but a ghastly accident,” they
urged, “helped along by Lulu Jennings; and,
though, of course, a couple of failures will pull
down your per cent., they need not entirely ruin it.
You are cleverer than Lulu. Look at arithmetic
alone, and the Visiting Board’s problems! She
hasn’t solved one of them.”</p>
<p>“We can’t hold <i>her</i> entirely responsible for
that,” returned Ernie, quaintly. “I am quite
sure he never intended they should be solved.”</p>
<p>“But you have worked out answers to them,”
retorted Mary.</p>
<p>“Yes,” Ernie admitted: “a different answer
every day.”</p>
<p>The problems in question were certainly difficult.
There were ten of them,—ingeniously
composed by “the Visiting Board”; and it was
rumoured among the girls that even Miss Horton,
herself, could not obtain a correct solution.
They were intended for practice-work during
the term, on the express understanding
that one of the set, no one could predict
which, should be included in the final examinations.</p>
<p>Naturally, they were the subject of much and
anxious discussion. Lulu Jennings, in particular,
suffered agonies of apprehensive doubt. Arithmetic
is not her strong point.</p>
<p>“I don’t think it’s fair,” she declared. “He
just meant to muddle us. The idea of making
up such stuff out of his own head! There isn’t
any key, or any way to prove ’em, and the answers
are not even in the back of Miss Horton’s
teacher’s book. I know, because——”</p>
<p>“Because?” questioned Mary Hobart. And
Lulu dropped her eyes, and coloured uncomfortably.</p>
<p>It was after her public disgrace that Ernie
wrote out the entire set of problems in a blank-book
purchased for the purpose, so that she might
study them quietly at home. And how the child
did wrestle!—shutting herself in the workshop
Saturday after Saturday, till finally she discovered
the correct solution! There could be no
doubt. Worked out along certain intricate lines
the problems could be proved!</p>
<p>The next morning, which happened to be the
very day before examination, Ernie carried her
precious book down to school.</p>
<p>“<i>Coo-ee!</i>” she yodeled to Mary Hobart, who
formed one of a group of chattering girls on the
second landing. “I have the answers!”</p>
<p>“Not to the Visiting Board’s problems?” returned
Mary, excitedly.</p>
<p>“Yes,” Ernie replied, unable to repress her
glee. “They are here!” tapping the book as she
spoke. “And they are right, too. They prove!—all
those I’ve had time for!”</p>
<p>At that moment Lulu Jennings brushed past
the excited pair. Apparently she was deep in
conversation with a friend, and noticed nothing.</p>
<p>“If only she guessed!” chuckled Ernestine.</p>
<p>“Well, for goodness’ sake don’t tell her!”
warned Mary, the cautious. “I wouldn’t trust
that girl with her own grandmother’s plated
spoons.”</p>
<p>“Do you take me for a goose?” asked Ernie.
“Let’s put our books up, and perhaps we’ll have
time to eat an apple before the bell rings. I have
a beauty in my blouse!”</p>
<p>So the two girls ran up to the classroom,
where they found that Lulu had preceded them,
slipped their books into their respective desks,
and, returning to the schoolyard, divided the
apple.</p>
<p>“I wish I could explain the problems to you,
Mary dear,” Ernie said. “But, of course, it
wouldn’t be fair. It was quite by chance I hit on
the right way. You can imagine my joy! I
have only had time to prove the first six, but the
others must be right. I’ll work on them at
noon.”</p>
<p>However, long before noon, Ernie slipped her
hand into her desk to take out the beloved book,
and reassure herself by a hasty glance through
its pages. She owns several blank-books; one
for spelling, a second for “home-work,” and a
third for English. These were successively
dragged out, and hastily thrust back again.
With a queer little shock it became certain that
the book containing the solution to the all-important
problems was missing!</p>
<p>Ernie was puzzled, startled, but, just at first,
she felt no suspicion.</p>
<p>Perhaps she had not put the book into her
desk, after all. Perhaps she had dropped it on
the landing in the hall. It was impossible to
communicate her loss to Mary Hobart, who had
been sent to the blackboard to demonstrate a
proposition. So Ernie raised her hand and asked
Miss Horton’s permission to leave the room to
look for something. The request was granted.</p>
<p>Yet a hurried search of the stairways revealed
nothing; and the more Ernie reflected, the more
anxious she became. She returned to the classroom
thoroughly puzzled and distressed.—When
what was her amazement to discover the missing
book lying in plain view on her desk!</p>
<p>Ernie took it up incredulously,—and was instantly
conscious of a faint scent of musk.</p>
<p>She turned to Mary Hobart, who was just
about to resume her seat, having finished her
work at the board, and fairly hissed:—</p>
<p>“<i>Smell of Lulu, Mary. Smell her! quick!!!</i>”</p>
<p>Mary looked at Ernie in bewilderment. “I
don’t <i>want</i> to,” she whispered back. “Why
should I, I’d like to know?”</p>
<p>“Go on,” commanded Ernie, too excited to explain.
“Smell her! You must!”</p>
<p>So Mary, with a puzzled and somewhat resentful
air, inclined her head stiffly toward Lulu Jennings
and began to sniff.</p>
<p>“Well?” questioned Ernie, with dilating
eyes.</p>
<p>“Well,” returned Mary, crossly; “she smells of
cheap perfume, as usual. It’s musk to-day. I
hope you’re satisfied.”</p>
<p>“Yes,” returned Ernie, quietly. “And so, I
haven’t a doubt, is Lulu. She has copied my
problems! I’ll tell you after school.”</p>
<p>Certainly the evidence seemed conclusive
enough, and Mary added still other links to the
chain.</p>
<p>“Don’t you remember?” she said. “Lulu was at
her desk when we put our things away this morning.
While we were eating that apple, she must
have taken the book; and no sooner did you leave
the room to look for it, than she asked permission
to put some stuff in the wastepaper-basket. I
noticed, from the blackboard, that she paused at
your desk on her way back. She must certainly
have returned it then.”</p>
<p>Yet what was to be done? The affair was
entirely too complicated to take to Miss Horton,
even if Ernie could have made up her mind to
that course.</p>
<p>“No,” she returned to Mary’s suggestion. “I
just won’t. I’m no tell-tale. I’d rather give up
all thought of the prize, even if I have worked so
hard for it. If Lulu Jennings can enjoy the
books earned this way, she’s welcome to ’em!”
And Ernie thrust the fatal blank-book into the
very bottom of her school-satchel, and snapped to
the catch with a click!</p>
<p>The next morning examinations began, with
arithmetic first as usual. Every girl in the class
surveyed her paper anxiously, in search of the
famous problem. It was there,—the ninth,—one
of the four which Ernie had neglected to prove.
At first this was rather a disappointment; but,
having given up all hope of winning the prize,
Ernie quickly dismissed the matter and set quietly
to work, merely determining to pass as creditably
as she could.</p>
<p>The moments flew quickly by. Absorbed in
her calculations, Ernie forgot all feeling of pique
or disappointment; nor did she again think of
Lulu Jennings till, having finished her paper, she
passed it under final review, when something
struck her eye!</p>
<p>She gave a little bounce in her seat, and caught
her breath sharply. The answer obtained to the
all-important problem was different to-day from
that which she had written out before!</p>
<p>She remembered distinctly what that other answer
was, and went hastily over the work before
her to see where the mistake lay. But it was
right. It proved! Figure by figure Ernie followed
the intricate proposition, to which, without
a doubt, she had at last obtained the correct solution!
What had been wrong before she did not
know, nor did she much care.</p>
<p>Instinctively her glance sought Lulu Jennings,
who sat with head bent low above her desk.
At the same moment Lulu raised her eyes. She
did not look at Ernie, but cautiously toward Miss
Horton, who was standing at the blackboard
with her back toward the class. Lulu, seeing
this, darted a stealthy hand into her desk, and
brought out a little roll of paper which she placed
in her lap, at the same moment throwing her
handkerchief over it.</p>
<p>Ernie did not wait for anything further, but,
rising from her seat, carried her paper to Miss
Horton’s desk. No one paid any attention, as
it is customary for the girls to put up their papers
when finished. On her way back Ernie stopped
beside Lulu just long enough to whisper,—</p>
<p>“I wouldn’t bother to copy that. It’s
wrong.”</p>
<p>Lulu turned first white, then red. She clutched
the paper in her lap. Whether she heeded
Ernie’s warning makes little difference. The
mark she received was not especially creditable;
and Ernie, who passed a nearly perfect examination,
came out head, and was awarded the prize,
after all.</p>
<p>“Just think, Elizabeth!” she chortled. “Five
dollars’ worth of books! We’ll fill up the bottom
shelf of the mahogany bookcase, again. I have
my list all made out:—<i>Water Babies</i>, for Robin;
<i>The Conquest of Granada</i>, for Hazard; Longfellow’s
poems for you, dear,—and <i>The Autocrat
of the Breakfast Table</i>, for mother. The Visiting
Board read the titles aloud from the platform,
and said it was ‘a remarkably comprehensive
selection.’”</p>
<p>“But, Ernie,” I expostulated, “what have you
for yourself?”</p>
<p>“Pshaw!” says Ernie—“I told you I was going
to use them for birthday presents. My birthday
is past; and besides I wanted nice editions,
and I really think I’ve made the money go as far
as anybody could!”</p>
<p>“It is very sweet of you, honey,” I said; “but
we will share that Longfellow. Aren’t Mary
and the other girls delighted?”</p>
<p>“Indeed they are,” admitted Ernie, with an
ingenuous little skip. “I’m quite the Heroine of
their young hearts! It’s lots of fun, Elizabeth.
Only, I’m sorry for Lulu. It must be horrid for
her to look back and think how mean she has
been,—and all for nothing, too!”</p>

<div class='rb-container'><div class='rb'>
<h2 class='mt2em mb1em fs1r0em chapter'>Wednesday, February 11.</h2>
</div></div>
<p class='ti0'>Our precious Robin has been far from well,
lately. For some time now he has almost
given up trying to walk. His crutches seemed to
tire him more and more, and his left side has become
so helpless that when he did attempt to get
about it reminded one of a little lame bird trailing
a broken wing.</p>
<p>The greater part of the day he has passed
propped up with pillows in the big rocker in the
window, or lying in his little crib, because he was
“too tired” to sit up. And the deepening shadows
beneath his eyes have quite wrung our
hearts.</p>
<p>Dr. Porter has been very kind and attentive,
but far from satisfied; and last week the stern
edict went forth. Robin was to go to bed and
stay there for no less a period than six weeks,
with a heavy weight attached to his little thin
leg.</p>
<p>Well, there is one comfort. Our darling baby
seems more like himself since he has been forced
at last to give up. He has lost some of the languor
and gentle indifference that seemed to be
growing on him. His merry grin flashes forth
with reassuring frequency, followed by the deep
dimple high in his cheek.</p>
<p>“He is resting,” said the doctor, “and he needs
it. That boy is grit clear through,—a quality of
which I don’t approve in patients, Miss Elizabeth.”</p>
<p>“Would you rather have them whine?” I asked.</p>
<p>“Yes,” returned the doctor, uncompromisingly.
“I would.”</p>
<p>But Robin will never do that. In the first
place, everybody is too good to him;—Mrs. Burroughs,
Miss Brown, and the three Lysles. Indeed,
Mr. Lysle is kind as kind can be. He has
brought fruit for Bobsie several times, and seems
quite distressed because “the little invalid” has
not a better appetite. To-day he declared that he
really did not see “how the child managed to survive
on such a small amount of sustenance.”
Whereat Ernie giggled, and I had some difficulty
controlling my countenance, for it was at the table
the observation was rumbled forth, just as the
kind “Hippopotamus” was finishing his third
helping of turkey.</p>
<p>Yes, turkey! if you please; though certainly it
did seem some weeks ago as if the little Grahams
could never again claim even so much as a bowing
acquaintance with that royal bird. And after the
turkey came ice cream and mince pie, served by
Rose in a spotless cap and apron, while Rosebud
purred upon the warm hearth in the kitchen, waiting
his turn to lick the plates! For no sooner
did plenty begin to smile again upon our household
than Ernie (naughty Indian-giver!), demanded
back her pet. “Mary would just as soon
have one of the grocer’s new kittens,” she affirmed.
“I’ve asked him about it, and he says we
may take our pick.” So the compromise was
effected. Rosebud, sleek and debonair as ever,
returned to grace our home,—and such a welcome
as the children gave him! Indeed, we were all
glad. Things have not been so comfortable for
months,—which reminds me of Robin’s poem.</p>
<p>It was this morning, while I was washing his
face, that Bobs repeated it to me. A little soap
got into his eyes. He screwed them up, and then
remarked,—</p>
<p>“You must be more careful, Elizabeth, when
you wash me, else my poem won’t stay true.”</p>
<p>“Your poem, Bobsie?” I repeated. Though,
certainly, by this time I should be accustomed to
the family weakness.</p>
<p>“Yes,” answered Robin, shyly. “Ernie wrote
one, you know, and Haze, too,—so I thought I
would. Shall I say it?”</p>
<p>And, without waiting to be pressed, he graciously
began:—</p>
<div class='cb-container'><div class='cb'>
<div>“Oh, what a lucky child am I,</div>
<div>As here upon my bed I lie</div>
<div>With all my needs and wants supplied,</div>
<div>My food, and everything beside;—</div>
<div>Clams, and white mice, and kittens, all!</div>
<div>And when I’m cold my mother’s shawl.”</div>
</div></div>
<p>“Isn’t that pretty?”</p>
<p>“Indeed it is, honey,” I answered. “How did
you come to think of it?”</p>
<p>“Well,” confessed Robin, “I’d been crying just
a little yesterday, Ellie, because I wanted to pertend
to play tag and I couldn’t see out the window,
and so I had to blow my nose; and I felt for
my hankersniff under the pillow, and <i>there</i> it was!
I didn’t have to ring or anything! And that
made me think how lucky I am, and so I made up
the poem. Is it nice enough to be written down?”</p>
<p>“It certainly is,” I answered. “I will put it
in my diary, and some day when you are a big
fat man Ellie will read it aloud to you, and we
will both laugh.”</p>
<p>“Why will we laugh, Ellie dear?” asked Robin,
innocently.</p>
<p>“Because we will be so glad that the little sick
boy who composed it grew up strong and well,”
I answered.</p>
<p>And so I have written “the poem” here, that I
may be able to fulfil my part of the prophecy.</p>
<p>But now I want to talk a little of Geoffrey, for
we are really anxious about him. There is no
doubt the boy is very much changed.</p>
<p>Yesterday afternoon he dropped in to see Ernie
nearly an hour before school was out.</p>
<p>“Why, Geof,” I said, “what are you doing
here so early? It is scarcely two o’clock. Ernie
isn’t home yet. Did you have a half-holiday?”</p>
<p>Geoffrey looked confused. “’Guess your clocks
are wrong,” he answered. “Can you give a fellow
a bit of lunch, Elizabeth?”</p>
<p>“I thought you got your lunch at school,” I returned.
“But, of course,—if you are hungry.
Rose has just finished baking. Isn’t that luck?”
And I ran down to the kitchen, where a glass of
milk, a couple of bananas, and a plate of hot ginger-bread
were quickly collected.</p>
<p>Geof ate in silence, crumbling his ginger-bread
over the tray cloth on the library table.</p>
<p>“Geoffrey!” I remonstrated. “That’s too good
to waste. What you don’t want I am going to
take up to Robin.”</p>
<p>“All right,” answered Geof, pushing his plate
indifferently toward me. “How is the kid?”
Then he broke into a short chuckle. “I say,
Elizabeth,” he remarked, “there’s a trained
bear out at the zoo that would tickle Bobs
most to death. I’ve been feeding it peanuts
all the morning. It’s gentle as a kitten, the
keeper says,—jolly good sort he seems, too,—and——”</p>
<p>“Geoffrey!” I accused, in sudden shocked enlightenment.
“You have been playing hookey.”</p>
<p>Geof flushed angrily, and bit his lip. “Well,
and if I have?” he blustered. “It’s nobody’s
business but my own, I suppose!”</p>
<p>“It certainly is somebody’s business,” I answered,
decidedly. “And you ought to be
ashamed of yourself. After all the trouble you
were in last term over hockey and athletics, I
should think you would have learned that such
foolishness doesn’t pay.”</p>
<p>Geof sprang to his feet. “Now see here, Elizabeth,”
he said, “I’m not going to be jawed by
you. I get enough of that sort of talk at home.
If you can’t be pleasant, I’ll go somewhere else.
There are plenty of other places where a chap can
spend the afternoon, and Hollister and Sam Jacobs
are glad enough to show ’em to me.”</p>
<p>“Very well, Geoffrey,” I answered. “If you
choose to treat the matter so! Only, I warn you
frankly, in that case I shall go directly upstairs
and tell mother,—I shan’t feel that I have any
choice,—and she will tell Uncle George, I
know.”</p>
<p>Geof turned on me incredulously. “You
sneak!” he cried. “If that doesn’t sound exactly
like Meta!”</p>
<p>“Oh, Geof dear!” I expostulated, hurt and
shocked by his violence. “Don’t let’s quarrel,
or misunderstand each other. You know very
well I don’t want to get you into trouble. But
Sam Jacobs and Jim Hollister are not the sort of
fellows you ought to associate with. I don’t believe
you really enjoy the places they take you to,
either,—and in the end it can’t help but be found
out. You are doing yourself an injustice, Geoffrey,—truly
you are! Come, let’s sit down and
talk things over quietly.”</p>
<p>I laid my hand on his arm. He tried to shake
it off,—but the next instant his face changed.</p>
<p>“Hang it all, Elizabeth!” he blurted out. “If I
had sisters like you and Ernie,—or a mother!”</p>
<p>And the first thing I knew big, strong, manly
Geof had broken down, and was sobbing like a
baby, his head buried in his arms on the library
table.</p>
<p>And presently the whole wretched story came
out. It seems that things have been going from
bad to worse ever since last September. It was
only by unusual pressure brought to bear by Aunt
Adelaide, and equally unusual acquiescence on the
part of the school authorities, that Geof managed
to be promoted with his class this year, and
he entered the new grade heavily conditioned in
nearly all his studies. This, in itself, was bad;
but what made the matter still harder was that
in his case a weekly report has been substituted
for the customary monthly one; he tutors three
afternoons a week; and his progress is kept under
rigid supervision.</p>
<p>“So if I’m not nagged about French, I am
about Latin,” said poor Geoffrey; “and I tell you,
Elizabeth, the schedule I’m carrying this year is
enough to daze a Solomon.”</p>
<p>“But do you really try to study, Geof?” I
asked. “Have you made one honest effort to set
things right?”</p>
<p>Geof flushed. “Yes; I have,” he answered,
sullenly. “But nobody believes it. And recently
I’ve had so many headaches, and I don’t sleep
well nights, and——”</p>
<p>“If Aunt Adelaide knew that?” I suggested.</p>
<p>“She’d think I was faking,” concluded Geof,
hardily. “And I don’t know that I blame her
much,” he admitted, the next minute. “You see,
we never have gotten along. I was seven when
my own mother died, and nine when the governor
remarried,—just old enough to resent it. I remember
for three weeks I wouldn’t call her
‘mamma,’ till finally the matter was taken to
headquarters, and I had to. And then Meta
didn’t make things any easier. We fought from
the very start. And they’ve managed to set the
governor against me, till now—Well, the latest
threat is, if my March reports don’t show
‘marked improvement’ I’m to be packed off to
the Catskills for the summer to a little tin soldier
camp, where the fellows wear toy uniforms and
tutor all through vacation. Pleasant prospect!”</p>
<p>“Then, Geoffrey, why in the world play
hookey,” I asked, “and throw away your last possible
chance of avoiding it?”</p>
<p>Geof was silent.</p>
<p>“Come, be sensible,” I urged. “Things do
look black, I admit, but if for the next few weeks
you learn the lessons set each day, and look
neither forward nor back——”</p>
<p>“That’s just it,” interrupted Geof. “You’ve
hit the nail on the head. There’s too much behind
me, Elizabeth. I can’t learn what we are
having now, because I didn’t last term, or the
year before. And,—and, you haven’t any idea
how hard it is when everybody is down on a chap.
Now that I’m out of athletics the fellows I used
to go with have no further use for me; I never
did get along with the grinds; and Hollister, Jacobs,
and their set are always cordial and pleasant,
at least. I’ve got to associate with somebody,
I suppose? You don’t know what you are
talking about,—that’s all.”</p>
<p>“Yes, I do, Geoffrey,” I replied. “It won’t be
easy to turn round, I know;—but what is the use
of complicating matters still further? Right
is right, and wrong wrong; and hookey never
paid yet. Will you give me your word that you
will go to school to-morrow?”</p>
<p>Again Geof was silent, and I waited. It
seemed hard, unsympathetic,—yet what was I to
do? “Will you give me your word, Geof?” I
reiterated.</p>
<p>“All right,” he muttered, sullenly, at last.
“You have the whip-hand. I’ll go to school to-morrow
and the day after. I won’t promise
more than that. And Saturday, if I haven’t seen
the governor myself, you are welcome to go and
tell him anything you please. Does that satisfy
you?”</p>
<p>It did not, entirely; but in Geof’s stubborn
mood it was the best I could hope for, and at least
he will have time to think things over till the end
of the week. Poor, foolish fellow! I hope I
shan’t be obliged to tell!</p>

<p class='ti0'>Geoffrey has run away! So that was
what he meant by promising to go to
school till Saturday! Oh, I feel as if I were
partly responsible;—and yet, how could I have
suspected?</p>
<p>He was over here late yesterday afternoon. I
did not have a chance to see him, as mother was
out, and Robin rather feverish and fretful; but
Ernie and he talked together in the workshop for
nearly a couple of hours, and after he went Ernie
came down to dinner with such red eyes.</p>
<p>“What is it, dear?” I asked, at last, when she
and I were undressing together in our little room.
“Was Geof in one of his moods again?” For
Ernie had been on the verge of tears all the
evening.</p>
<p>She dropped upon the bed then, with a little
wail, and buried her face in the pillows. “I
should say he was,” she sobbed. “I couldn’t do
a thing with him. That hateful military camp!
It’s enough to drive anybody to desperation!”</p>
<p>“Is it settled?” I asked. “Must Geof really
go?”</p>
<p>“Oh, don’t bother, Elizabeth,” returned Ernie,
almost crossly. “He’s going to talk to Uncle
George to-night. He gets his allowance Fridays,
you know; and to-morrow we’ll hear.”</p>
<p>Then she turned her face to the wall and pretended
to go to sleep; but she was restless for
hours, and once she cried out wildly in her
dreams:</p>
<p>“Geoffrey! you mustn’t! You mustn’t, I tell
you!”</p>
<p>No wonder she was anxious, poor child; for it
seems that Geoffrey, after having first obtained a
promise of secrecy, confided his plans to her
yesterday afternoon. She is the only person who
knows where he is now, and entreaties and arguments
are equally of no avail. We simply cannot
get her to tell.</p>
<p>The first alarm reached us this morning, just
as we had risen from the breakfast table. There
was a sharp ring at the door-bell; and Rose, answering
the summons, found Maria, one of Aunt
Adelaide’s maids, outside.</p>
<p>“Is Master Geoffrey here?” asked Maria,
rather breathlessly. And, upon receiving Rose’s
denial, she cried out:</p>
<p>“Then Lord-a-mercy knows what’s become of
him! For he ain’t been home all the morning,
not even to his breakfast, and missis and the boss,
too, are in a great taking!”</p>
<p>Mother and I, who were on our way upstairs,
overheard the exclamation and turned back.</p>
<p>“What is it, Maria?” asked mother, after having
sent Rose down to the kitchen again. “Master
Geoffrey has not been here since yesterday.
You say he was not home to breakfast?”</p>
<p>“No, ma’am,” answered Maria; and proceeded
to pour forth her tale. It seems that Geoffrey
has been in the habit of over-sleeping recently,
which indulgence greatly irritated Aunt Adelaide.</p>
<p>“Mrs. Graham thinks it’s only manners for the
family to sit down to meals together,” Maria explained.
“So this morning when Master Geoffrey
did not come, she sent Jennie up to knock at
his door, and Jennie, she knocked, and knocked
again, and got no answer. So after a bit she
came down, and said she could not make Master
Geoffrey hear, and Mr. Graham jumped up.</p>
<p>“‘I’ll wake him myself,’ he says. ‘We’ve had
enough of this sort of nonsense.’ And he went
and called very angry-like at the foot of the
stairs; but still there was no reply;—and I was
rather sorry for Master Geoffrey when his pa
snatched off one of his slippers and ran upstairs
and threw open the bedroom door.</p>
<p>“‘He’s going to catch it, sure enough, like any
babby,’ I thought; but he didn’t, because the
room was empty. The bed had not even been
slept in.</p>
<p>“‘Hello!’ says Mr. Graham, in a disturbed sort
of way. And he put on his slipper and came
downstairs again; and directly breakfast was
over they sent me here.”</p>
<p>“Can Ernie know anything of this?” asked
mother, turning to me. “She is Geoffrey’s usual
confidante. Run upstairs and get her, Elizabeth.
I believe she has taken Robin his tray.”</p>
<p>All the colour died out of Ernie’s face when
she saw me enter the nursery; but it flooded back
again in a crimson wave as she listened to
mother’s message. However, she settled Bobsie
to his breakfast, and quietly followed me downstairs.</p>
<p>“Have you any idea where Geoffrey is,
Ernie?” asked mother, gravely.</p>
<p>Ernie’s long lashes swept her cheeks. “Isn’t
he at home?” she returned, in a tone that was intended
to sound innocent.</p>
<p>Mother smiled, just a little. “Don’t be foolish,
dear,” she replied. “If you know anything
about Geoffrey it is only right for you to tell us.
We are not his enemies.”</p>
<p>For a moment Ernie stood silent; then she
said, very low, “I know, but I can’t tell. I’ve
promised.”</p>
<p>At that instant there sounded a second peal at
the bell. This time it was Uncle George. Never
before in my life have I seen him so upset, though
it was evident he tried to appear indifferent.</p>
<p>His first words were addressed to Maria.</p>
<p>“Go home to your mistress, my good girl,” he
said.</p>
<p>Then, turning to mother,—“It does not answer
to send servants on such errands. They
simply stand and gossip.”</p>
<p>Mother flushed a little. “Maria is quite blameless,”
she replied. “I desired to hear all she
knew in regard to Geoffrey. Have you any
further news?”</p>
<p>Uncle George laid his hat carefully upon a
chair, and felt in his coat pocket.</p>
<p>“It seems the young scamp left a note,” he
said, in a voice that was husky, despite his assumption
of unconcern. “It was not in his room,
or we would have found it earlier. He gave it
to Georgie last night, telling him to give it to me
this morning as soon as he had finished breakfast
in the nursery.” And Uncle George handed
mother a folded sheet of paper.</p>
<p>“<i>Dear father</i>,” we read,—I was looking over
her shoulder,—</p>
<div class='blockq'>
<p>“I find that I shall
have to go away for I ment what I
said wen you gave me my money tonight. It would be beastly
to go to that miletary-camp and I cant studdy and keep
things up in the way that is expected it makes my headache.
Perhaps there is something the matter with that
part of my bran wich I have inherited from you. But dont
worry this will not keep me from being a good bizness man
wich has always been the fate I have most wished for. I
am sorry to have made so much trubble and Ill come back
some day. Dont let Georgie forget me and dont you forget
me either</p>
<div class='rb-container'><div class='rb'>
<div>“Your loving son</div>
<div><span class='sc'>“Geoffrey Meadows Graham.”</span></div>
</div></div>
</div>
<p>I wanted to cry as I read it. Poor, blundering,
affectionate Geof, with his atrocious spelling
and his “inherited bran.”</p>
<p>Mother handed the note to Uncle George again,
without a word.</p>
<p>“Well?” he asked, shortly.</p>
<p>“It is very like Geoffrey,” she said; “though I
never could have supposed he would run away.
What are you going to do?”</p>
<p>“I, myself,” returned Uncle George, “would
prefer to wait and give the young beggar a chance
to grow tired of his experiment. That’s the medicine
he needs. A chap who can throw over a
good home such as Geoffrey has, ought to be
made to rough it a bit. But the women folk
won’t hear of it. Meta and her mother are in a
great taking. They imagine all sorts of foolishness,
and it’s on account of them, more especially,
that I have come over to interview your Ernie.
Come, young woman! What have you got to
say for yourself? Do you know anything of
Geoffrey’s whereabouts?”</p>
<p>Again Ernie flushed crimson, lowered her eyelids,
and remained silent.</p>
<p>“I have already questioned Ernestine,” said
mother. “She undoubtedly knows certain facts
which would be very useful. I hope that I shall
be able to convince her it is her duty to tell
us.”</p>
<p>Uncle George looked from mother to Ernie in
blank amazement. “Do you mean to say she
won’t tell?” he demanded. “Then there is only
one way out of it. She must be made to.”</p>
<p>“I shall try to show Ernie that it is the only
way in which she can be of any help to Geoffrey,”
answered mother, quietly.</p>
<p>Uncle George frowned impatiently.</p>
<p>“I’ll tell you what,” he said, after a moment’s
thought. “I’ll give her a five-dollar gold piece
for the first bit of information she has to give
us. What’s more, I’ll make it twenty-five dollars,
if it leads to Geoffrey’s capture before night.
What do you say to that, my girl?”</p>
<p>It would be impossible to describe the look of
horror depicted in Ernie’s features. Betray Geof,
her dear chum, her more than brother, for a sordid
money reward! If Uncle George had only
known it, our last chance of winning Ernie was
lost when he uttered those hateful words. But
he did not know, and it would have been impossible
to make him understand. On the contrary,
he picked up his hat with a satisfied expression of
having set things on the right track, at last, and
after a final injunction “to keep him informed,”
left us.</p>
<p>Mother and I looked hopelessly at one another
as the front door closed behind him.</p>
<p>“Ernie, dear,” said mother, very gently, “setting
aside all thought of Uncle George’s offer, for,
of course, it is out of the question that you should
accept any money,—I expect you to tell me at
once all you know in regard to Geoffrey’s plans.
It may be the means of saving him great hardship,
and discomfort.”</p>
<p>“Yes, Ernie,” I urged. “And everybody is
agreed that it is much better to break a bad promise
than to keep it. Doesn’t your own common-sense
tell you that?”</p>
<p>But reason, command, entreat as we might,
Ernie remained obdurate.</p>
<p>She sat on the top stair leading down to the
basement, the big tears welling in her blue eyes
and trickling along her nose till they dropped
from the tip with a little splash into her lap; listening
plaintively to all we said, replying nothing,—a
moving picture of stubborn misery.</p>
<p>At last mother desisted.</p>
<p>“Ernie,” she said, “I want you distinctly to
understand that I am both disappointed and displeased
with you. You are the one person who
can be of any help to Geoffrey; but I shall ask
you no further questions. When your own good
feeling and sense of right prompt you to follow
my wishes, I shall be ready to listen to you.”</p>
<p>Then mother dressed and went to see Aunt
Adelaide; I ran up to the nursery to Robin; and
Ernie locked herself in the workshop, where she
set to work painting a gorgeous family of Japanese
paper dolls for Mary Hobart’s birthday,—spattering
their beflowered kimonos ever and
again with a salty drop. She was very forlorn,
poor darling;—distressed beyond measure to feel
that her family disapproved of her. Yet she had
given her word to Geof.</p>
<p>So the morning passed. Lunch time came,
and still there was no news. The afternoon
dragged even more heavily; and when Hazard
came home from the office in the evening he told
us that Uncle George had three detectives looking
for Geof, but as yet they had found no clue.</p>
<p>Dinner was somewhat of an ordeal. I had the
head of the table, as mother did not feel she could
leave Aunt Adelaide, who is in a very apprehensive
and nervous state. We tried to keep the conversation
to general topics, but the anecdotal vein
of the boarders was not to be stemmed. It seems
that Geoffrey’s escapade reminded everybody of
some long-forgotten incident in his or her own
family, or the family of a friend, or even a
friend’s friend.</p>
<p>Nothing was too far-fetched to be appropriate,
every possible climax to the adventure was predicted,
and the same heartening conversation continued
when we gathered in the parlour after dinner
to wait for news. Till, finally, about half-past
ten or so, the boarders began to disperse to
their rooms;—yet not before Mr. Lysle had made
a brief, though painful, effort to win Ernie’s
confidence; for she is a favourite with the kind “Hippopotamus,”
and it grieved him to know her in
disgrace.</p>
<p>Therefore, interrupting his sister, who was
condoling with Miss Brown over the sad fate of
a nephew of the latter’s mother’s aunt, who
eloped with a sea captain’s daughter some sixty
years ago, and was finally eaten up by whales off
the Cape of Good Hope (I believe it was thus the
thrilling story ran), Mr. Lysle, with a sly wink
at his wife over the top of his newspaper, began:</p>
<p>“Miss Ernie! ahem!”</p>
<p>Ernie looked up from her “home-work,” and
the “Hippopotamus” continued ponderously:</p>
<p>“I suppose you are familiar with the famous
anecdote of George Washington and his hatchet?
How, when still a young boy, the Father of Our
Country found it impossible, even with the fear of
stern chastisement before him, to tell a—er—a—lie?”</p>
<p>Ernie cautiously refusing to commit herself to
any previous acquaintance with the incident, Mr.
Lysle continued blandly:—</p>
<p>“Now, my dear child, a similar opportunity is
presented to you,—an opportunity such as you
may never meet again—a grand opportunity! a
great one! The path of truth is a path of roses,
for all that it has its thorns,—even, if I may say
so, because of them!”</p>
<p>He paused impressively, and looked Ernie
firmly in the eye. We, the audience, waited
breathless, but still Mr. Lysle did not speak. So,
supposing, at last, the homily must be concluded,
we were about to return to our various avocations,
when he positively thundered forth:</p>
<p>“<i>Where</i> is your Cousin Geoffrey? Where is
that wilful lad? Speak! I command you!”</p>
<p>Everybody in the room jumped, and Miss
Lysle, who is nervous, uttered an hysterical little
squawk, like a frightened hen.</p>
<p>Ernie alone remained undaunted. The poor
“Hippopotamus” continued to gaze at her, triumph
fading to chagrin, till, finally, he turned
to his wife with such a disappointed air:—</p>
<p>“I thought I could surprise it out of her,” he
said; “but, evidently, I—er—couldn’t!” And a
few moments later he bade us a subdued “good-night”
and was soon followed upstairs by the rest
of the boarders.</p>
<p>It seems too strange to be sitting here writing
these things, with no idea where Geoffrey may
be! If only I did not feel my own responsibility
so keenly! I can see now that I should have told
mother last Tuesday when first I heard of Geof’s
trou——. There is the bell! It may be news....</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<p>Yes! and good news, too. Geoffrey is found!
He was brought home about eleven o’clock by
one of Uncle George’s detectives, who ran across
him in a little out-of-the-way cottage in Elizabeth,
where he had spent the day with a German
woman, who was once a cook at Uncle George’s
when Geoffrey’s own mother was alive. She is
married now, and has a neat little home of her
own, with three fat German babies.</p>
<p>There Geoffrey arrived late last night, and to-morrow
morning he had planned to set out again
on his travels and beat his way to South Dakota,
where Mrs. Prendergast, the German woman, has
a brother who works on a cattle ranch! Think
of it!</p>
<p>Dear little Ernie broke down completely when
she heard of Geoffrey’s capture. She threw herself
into mother’s arms, sobbing convulsively:—</p>
<p>“I didn’t mean to be naughty, mother dear!
I didn’t! And, of course, you know best—only
I had given my word, you see, and then Uncle
George might have <i>made</i> me take that hateful
money! Oh, what are they going to do to Geoffrey!”</p>
<p>“There! there, dear!” said mother. “Don’t cry
so. It is all over now. And as to Geoffrey, you
need not worry. Aunt Adelaide and Uncle
George are only too anxious to forgive him. He
has acted very wrongly, and given us all a
great fright; but it has been a lesson to everybody
concerned, and I don’t think Uncle George
holds Geoffrey entirely responsible.”</p>
<p>And later, after Ernie had snuggled down in
bed, where she dropped at once into an exhausted
sleep, mother confided to me that she, as well as
Aunt Adelaide, fears that Geoffrey is going to
be ill.</p>
<p>He seemed quite unlike himself this evening—indifferent
and almost dazed, and he still complained
of headache. Aunt Adelaide sent him
at once to bed, and this morning, if he is not better,
he is to see a doctor.</p>
<p>I say this morning, because it is already nearly
two o’clock. My eyes are sticky with sleep. I
cannot write another word, except to add that
even if Geof is to be ill, we are all thankful!</p>
</div>
<div class='chapter' id='d0217'>
<div class='rb-container'><div class='rb'>
<h2 class='mt2em mb1em fs1r0em chapter'>Tuesday, February 17.</h2>
</div></div>
<p class='ti0'>Geoffrey has typhoid fever. So,—mother
and Aunt Adelaide were right.
Oh, why could we not have suspected before?
The doctor says the disease has been coming on
for months;—which accounts for Geof’s headaches,
his sleepless nights, his general indifference
and lassitude. And we know, too, now, that he
never would have tried to run away, never
would have frightened us so, had he been
himself.</p>
<p>How hard and unsympathetic we must have
seemed these last weeks; for he was sick, poor
dear, and dazed, and stupid. He could not explain,
and we would not understand.</p>
<p>Well, we are going to be good to him, at last,
and make up,—Meta, Aunt Adelaide, all of us.
“Only,” says Ernie, with an anxious little frown
(it was she who brought the news this morning
before school), “we will have to wait a while, I
guess. Meta says Miss Barron, the trained
nurse, is a regular tyrant. She won’t let any one
near Geof.”</p>
<p>It seems that Meta wanted to go to Geoffrey
and apologise as soon as she heard that he had
typhoid. The memory of their various scraps
and misunderstandings troubled her. She made
quite a point of the matter, till Miss Barron
said it was out of the question. Then Meta determined
she would slip in on the sly,—for she is
very wilful, once she gets an idea into her head.
So she watched her chance, stole up when no one
was on guard, got as far as the door, and peeped
in.</p>
<p>The room was quite dark. Geoffrey’s head
was swathed in towels and an ice-bag; he kept
turning it from side to side upon the pillow. His
eyes were staring open, and he was muttering to
himself in an odd hoarse voice. Suddenly he
caught sight of Meta, who was advancing on tip-toe
into the room, started up on his elbow, and
shouted “<i>Scat!!</i>”</p>
<p>She turned and ran, poor thing, right into Uncle
George, who was coming upstairs with the
doctor, and he scolded her, and sent her to her
room.</p>
<p>I am afraid Geof is going to be very ill. Dr.
Porter, who called to see Robin this afternoon,
was extremely uncommunicative. “It is impossible
to predict at this stage,” was all we could get
him to say. “Fortunately, the boy has a good
constitution.”</p>

</div></div>
<p class='ti0'>Geoffrey desperately ill. He is delirious
the greater part of the time, or lies in
a heavy stupour.</p>
<p>Poor little Ernie, who goes every day for news,
crept up to his door yesterday morning, crouched
outside, and listened. Geof was singing in a
queer, hoarse voice:—</p>
<div class='cb-container'><div class='cb'>
<div>“Forty years on, when afar and asunder,</div>
<div>Parted are those who are singing to-day,</div>
<div>When you look back and forgetfully wonder,</div>
<div>What you were like in your work and your play....”</div>
</div></div>
<p class='ti0'>followed by snatches of the Eton Boating Song.
Then he would break off to shout football signals:—</p>
<p>“25, 39, 15—Left-end and Tackle over! 19, 56,
22—You fellows, there! What are you trying
for? 19’s a bluff! Can’t you remember what’s
told you,—confound it!”</p>
<p>Interspersed with muttered snatches of German,
and Latin paradigms. “And, oh,” mourned
Ernie, pathetically, “we’ve done dear Geof a
great injustice, Elizabeth. It’s amazing all that
boy knows! He repeated lines and lines of
Cæsar;—I only wish Haze could have heard him!—and
strings of irregular French verbs, and then
began to say the Capitals of the States, and exports
and imports! It was simply wonderful!
I felt so proud!”</p>
<p>But mother and I are frightened. Geof never
would have known such things in his right mind,
we feel sure; and we suspect that Dr. Porter fears
cerebral complications. A consultation was held
yesterday, and a second nurse has been engaged
to relieve Miss Barron.</p>

her.</p>

<h2 class='mt2em mb1em fs1r0em chapter'>Wednesday, March 18.</h2>
</div></div>
<p class='ti0'>I am desperate. I can’t bear it! I can’t!
We have just been told that our precious
Robin must undergo an operation. Didn’t we
have enough to endure without this? Geoffrey so
ill,—not past the crisis yet,—and now Bobsie, my
own baby, whom I love better than anything in
all the world!</p>
<p>God is cruel!... Oh, I don’t know what I
am writing! I must calm myself.</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<p>This afternoon, after hearing about Robin and
trying to write, and giving it up, I put on my hat
and jacket and escaped alone to the Park. I
walked fast, and just at first I did not notice anything,—the
bare branches of the trees against
the early sunset sky, the patches of melting snow
about the rhododendron bushes, the children
playing with their nurses on the common,—till
one little fellow with rosy cheeks and shining eyes
came running, laughing and shouting over his
shoulder, and stumbled against me. “’S’cuse
me!” he piped, and shied off again.</p>
<p>It was like a knife in my heart! I wondered
stupidly why it should hurt so, and sat down on a
bench to think;—and then I knew it was because
Robin had never run like that. Oh, he has
missed so much in his little life!</p>
<p>I remember perfectly Bobsie’s first birthday.
How I woke with a start, before it was yet light,
and saw the morning star, big and beautiful, shining
in at my window. I sat up in bed, and
clasped my knees and blinked at it,—conscious of
an unusual stir in the house. Till all at once
there rose a little cry! How my heart beat. I
jumped out of bed, slipped on my dressing gown
and slippers, and crept down the stairs to mother’s
door, where I crouched against the wall and
listened.</p>
<p>A few moments later the door opened, and
Mrs. Parsons, the nurse, poked her head out.
“Bless my soul,” she said, “I almost thought you
was a ghost, my dear. Run down to the library
like a good girl, and tell your pa that everything
is all right. It is a fine little boy and your
mamma is doing nicely.”</p>
<p>“Oh, nurse,” I breathed, “might I see the baby
first?”</p>
<p>“To be sure, you might,” answered Mrs. Parsons.
And she went back into the room and returned
again with a little white flannel bundle
which she laid in my arms.</p>
<p>And I put back a corner of the blanket and
peeped in, and there was Robin smiling up at me!
His eyes were big and dark, just as they are to-day,
and he blinked them. Everybody says it is
impossible that Robin should have smiled; but I
saw him, and I know. So the next morning, I
put away my dolls, and never played with them
again. It would have been too stupid, with a real
baby to mother, and dress, and sing to.</p>
<p>“She’s crying!” chirped a little voice. For I
was thinking of these things as I sat on the bench
in the Park; and sure enough the tears were on
my face, and I looked up to find three chubby tots
standing hand in hand before me, staring in a
solemn row.</p>
<p>So then I got up and came home again, since
I did not care to make a public spectacle of myself;—and
mother met me on the doorstep with
outstretched hands, and her own brave smile.</p>
<p>“My darling,” she said, “I meant to spare you;
but I am afraid it has come as too much of a
shock. Come into the parlour. We will have a
cup of cocoa.”</p>
<p>And when I was tucked snugly on the lounge
and had wept my little weep where no one could
see,—we talked it all out together. What comfortable
institutions mothers are!</p>
<p>It seems that if Robin does not have the operation
now he can never have it. A few months
later would be too late. And though Dr. Porter
had hoped to obviate the necessity by a long rest
in bed, everything else has failed. There remains
this one chance.</p>
<p>“So we must be brave for our baby, Elizabeth,”
explained mother. “He is too young to
make the decision for himself. The doctor spoke
to me of the matter first before Christmas. I
would not tell you then, dear, since there seemed
a chance of escape, and we had worries enough
without adding anything else. But that was why
I was so determined not to draw from our little
stock of money. <i>You</i> helped me there. Think
how thankful we should be that we do not have
to borrow, that we can engage a nurse for Robin,—everything
that is necessary. He need not
even be moved to a hospital, Dr. Porter says. It
will all be over in a couple of weeks, and whatever
the result there will be the inexpressible comfort
of knowing that everything possible has been
tried. Are you satisfied? Do you blame me?”</p>
<p>“No, no, indeed!” I answered. “Only,—I
think I hate the doctor!”</p>
<p>“Oh, Elizabeth!” smiled mother, as she took
my empty cocoa-cup and put it upon the table.
“And now I want you to run up to your room,
bathe your face, and put on a pretty frock. Mrs.
Burroughs has sent over a charming mould of
orange jelly and some lady-fingers for Robin.
There is to be a tea-party in the nursery, and you
and Abraham Lincoln are invited. What do you
think of that?”</p>
<p>It was one of mother’s dear, considerate
schemes to save my tell-tale eyes from a downstairs
dinner. So I kissed her, sped up to my
room, dabbed a little powder on the tip of my
nose, and donned my forget-me-not dress.
Robin’s invitation should be honoured with the
best I had.</p>
<p>How his black eyes danced when I entered to
him in all my finery:—</p>
<p>“Allow me the Honour of Presenting my
Friend, Mr. Abraham Lincoln,” he piped.
“There’s the globe, Elizabeth, on the side of the
bed. You must pertend to shake hands, and
p’raps we can get him to eat a little lady-finger.”</p>
<p>So I pretended to shake hands with the much-enduring
Abraham Lincoln, and tempted him
with lady-fingers and orange jelly, both of which
delicacies he obstinately refused.</p>
<p>“Never mind,” says Robin. “He doesn’t
know what’s good. <i>We</i> will eat instead.”</p>
<p>Such a jolly party as it was! We told stories,
guessed riddles, and ran races to see who could
dispose of the most sandwiches; till even the kind
“Hippopotamus” could not have complained of
Robin’s appetite. But, at last, he grew tired, and
the weary pain returned:</p>
<p>“Take away the party, please, and sing to me,
Ellie dear,” he said.</p>
<p>So I carried the tray outside, and came back
and sat down by the bed, and with Robin’s thin
little hand in mine, sang to him,—all the dear,
familiar “heaven hymns” that we have both come
to love so well. And Bobsie cuddled up against
my arm and closed his eyes and sighed.</p>
<p>And then somehow I knew that if he is not to
grow up strong and straight like other boys, if he
is to suffer more and more as the years go by, it
would be cruel to want to keep Robin. And,
oh, I went on singing, and my voice did not
once break or trail! So perhaps God will forgive
the wicked words I wrote when I was so
wild,—for I believe I can be brave now because
after a bit Bobsie dropped asleep with his hand
still in mine, and—I think, before I left him, that
I said “good-bye.”</p>

<h2 class='mt2em mb1em fs1r0em chapter'>Sunday, March 22.</h2>
</div></div>
<p class='ti0'>It is over. All yesterday morning Ernie and
I sat on the attic stairs, holding each other’s
hands and trying to feel hopeful.</p>
<p>“He had such a pretty colour in his cheeks last
evening,” said Ernie, “and he did <i>so</i> enjoy looking
out the window. Buster was there, and John
waved his hand before they went away. It was
a good sign that the doctor should have let him
up in his chair for half an hour,—don’t you think
so, Elizabeth? Robin has a lot of vitality.”</p>
<p>“Yes; I know he has,” I agreed. “And if the
operation does go well,—how splendid it will
be!”</p>
<p>“Somehow one never thinks of Bobsie running
about like other boys,” continued Ernie,—“going
to school, and playing marbles, and doing errands.
I,—I can’t hardly realise it.”</p>
<p>“Neither can I,” I answered, and for a while
there was silence between us.</p>
<p>Then Ernie began again:—“How good everybody
has been! Uncle George even offered to
pay for the operation. I’m glad we didn’t have
to accept, though;—and we ought to be very
thankful, too, Elizabeth, about the boarders. The
oatmeal was burned this morning,—did you notice?—and
they never said ‘boo’! Just think,
if Mrs. Hudson had been here!”</p>
<p>“I know it,” I answered. “Oh, Ernie, if Robin
and Geof pull through, there is not another thing
in the world we could dare to ask for!”</p>
<p>“I’ve prayed, and prayed,” returned Ernie,
simply. “And I saw Miss Barron yesterday, and
she says that Geof is holding his own.”</p>
<p>Then for a long time we were quiet, each thinking
her own thoughts. It seemed as the morning
would never go.</p>
<p>“Robin isn’t feeling anything at all,” said
Ernie, at last. “Dr. Porter promised that. It
was to take about an hour, Elizabeth, only, of
course, there would be a great deal to get ready
first. I must see what time it is. It seems as if
we had been sitting here weeks!”</p>
<p>And Ernie opened the hall door and stole out
into the light, blinking like a little owl. A moment
more and she was back,—very white and
scared.</p>
<p>“It smells so of chloroform,” she confessed.
“I,—I didn’t quite reach the clock.”</p>
<p>So then we shut the door again, and waited a
long, long while; till, at last, we heard mother
call:—</p>
<p>“Elizabeth! Ernestine!”</p>
<p>I sat quite still, but Ernie ran down and threw
back the door:—“We are here, mother dear,
on the attic stairs.”</p>
<p>“Oh, my poor lambs,” said mother, with a little
catch in her voice. “Couldn’t you have found
a more comfortable place to wait? But it is over,
now. Dr. Porter declares the operation a complete
success; and Robin has come out from the
anæsthetic beautifully!”</p>
<p>“Oh!” gasped Ernie. And then, with a quick
little cry,—“Elizabeth! <i>Elizabeth!</i>”</p>
<p>I couldn’t see why she should be calling me,
when I was right there sitting on the top step
looking down at her. Till....</p>
<p>The next thing I knew they had me on the
attic floor, a pungent scent of ammonia at my
nose, while Ernie poured cold water down my
neck in a vain attempt to get me to swallow, and
mother relieved me of my collar-button.</p>
<p>“Go away!” I murmured, crossly. “I am only
resting.”</p>
<p>“Then do it with your eyes open,” commanded
Ernie. “We aren’t used to fainters in this
family!”</p>
<p>“I think she is all right, now,” said mother.
“We will get her into the workshop to Hazard’s
cot.”</p>
<p>So there, despite all my protestations, they put
me, and after a while the doctor came up and
gave me some medicine in a glass. It was very
mortifying, but he said I could not help it, and
perhaps if I had not made up my mind to expect
the worst, I should have borne the news better.
And, next, if you please, I went to sleep,—it was
that medicine, don’t tell me!—and never woke
till evening, when dear Haze brought up a tray
and sat beside me while I ate some chicken broth.</p>
<p>“Bobsie is doing splendidly,” he said. “Of
course, we have none of us seen him yet, except
mother. And, Elizabeth,—don’t faint, there’s
a good girl,—but Geof has passed the crisis!
They telephoned Uncle George at noon. The
office had a half-holiday. I came home, heard
the good news about Robin, and then went shopping!”</p>
<p>“Shopping, Hazey?” I repeated; for it seemed
rather an odd way for him to spend his afternoon.</p>
<p>“Yes,” returned Hazard. “Want to see what
I got?” And, with a somewhat conscious smile,
he sidled toward the workshop door. A moment
later and he was back, bearing a portentous-looking
package:—which, the wrappings being
quickly removed, revealed a beautiful Clement
Braun print of the Sistine Madonna, finished in
soft sepia tints and set off by a charmingly tasteful
frame.</p>
<p>“Oh, Hazard!” I cried. “How lovely! Is it
for Robin? No,—he is hardly old enough. You
must have bought it for mother.”</p>
<p>“Well, I didn’t then,” contradicted Haze.
“It’s just for you, my dear. You see I had
planned to get something like this at Christmas,
but I lost my money, and couldn’t; and you stood
by me like a trump, while all the rest of the world
thought I was pretty much of an ass,—and didn’t
hesitate to say so, occasionally. Sometimes I
have been afraid you didn’t know that I appreciate
what a splendid chum you are, Elizabeth.
So I determined to find some way to show you,
and as soon as I began to draw my salary again
I thought of this. It’s an Easter present,—but I
wanted you to have it to-day.”</p>
<p>“You dear!” I cried. “Oh, Haze, I’ve always
wanted this Madonna. But it must have cost a
lot,—and you have given mother two dollars
every single week! How did you ever manage?”</p>
<p>Hazey blushed beamfully. “That’s all right,”
he answered with becoming modesty. “I’m glad
you like it.”</p>
<p>And, looking up, I noticed again what mother
and I were commenting upon only the other day.</p>
<p>“Hazard,” I accused, “you are thin! You
have been saving from your lunches,—don’t
deny it!”</p>
<p>“Oh, I’m used to short rations,” admitted Hazard.
“It wasn’t anything at all, Elizabeth. But
it needn’t happen again, because (now <i>don’t</i> faint,
there’s a dear) I’ve been promoted, and am to
get five dollars a week from now on! It all
comes from my head for figures. You see, I’ve
been helping Mr. Simpkins lately,—he’s senior
accountant,—and he was pretty well satisfied with
my work. So when Bridges spoke of taking me
back into the outside office, what should the old
man do but go direct to Uncle George with the
matter, and say he couldn’t get along without me.
Uncle George was very much pleased, I really
think; so I’m to have what is practically a junior
clerk’s position,—though my official title is only
‘Simpkins’ boy,’—and a two-dollar increase in
salary. Rather a pretty turn of luck, hey?”</p>
<p>“Then you helped turn it, Haze darling,” I answered.
“And you’ve earned it every bit! You
have worked well and faithfully at things you
hated, without any hope of reward. Oh, I’m
proud of you,—we all are!”</p>
<p>And just at that moment mother and Ernie
came up, and helped me congratulate him;—and
after a bit, when we had discussed the news from
every possible point of view, we all went down to
hang the picture, and Ernie and Haze insisted
upon supporting me tenderly, one on either hand,
which was ridiculous! And before I went to bed
they let me in to kiss Robin; ... and now it is
to-morrow morning. I am sitting at my desk
writing, with, oh, such a thankful heart! while
above me on the wall hangs Raphael’s most beautiful
Madonna, quite glorifying and illuminating
this shabby little room.</p>

<h2 class='mt2em mb1em fs1r0em chapter'>Sunday, April 5.</h2>
</div></div>
<p class='ti0'>Spring has come at last with Easter. Such
a beautiful blue sky as we woke to this morning,
such tender breaths of gusty air!</p>
<p>“It seems funny to be putting on one’s winter
hat,” remarked Ernie, cheerfully, as she picked up
her shabby gray beaver and shook out its matted
pompon; while I sniffed suspiciously at my white
gloves in the window, wondering if they really
did whiff faintly of gasoline.</p>
<p>“Yes,” I admitted. “Hand me that whisk-broom,
please. Everybody will be wearing new
clothes but us to-day, and we haven’t got any.
Do you care?”</p>
<p>“I should think myself pretty mean if I did,”
returned Ernie, roundly. “Come on, Elizabeth.
The bells are ringing. We have barely time to
say good-bye to Bobs.”</p>
<p>The nursery windows were open. The sunshine
fell in bright patches across Robin’s little
white crib, where he lay among his pillows, literally
embowered amid blossoming plants.</p>
<p>“See, Elizabeth,” he called. “Here’s another!—a
crimson bramble rose. It hasn’t any card,
’cept just a happy Easter one. Mother can’t
guess who sent it, so I think <i>maybe</i> it was Mrs.
<i>Bo</i>-gardus! That makes five flowers, and two
rabbits, and three chickens, and a little red
prayer-book, all for me! Here’s a pansy for you
and Ernie, please; ’cause you want to look pretty
Easter day.”</p>
<p>“Thank you, honey,” we answered. And,
though the stems were very short, we managed to
pin Robin’s pansies into our coats.</p>
<p>“They are playing ‘Welcome, happy morning!’”
said Ernestine, as the front door closed behind
us, and the jubilant music of the chimes
rang more clearly to our ears. “Oh, Elizabeth,
we <i>are</i> happy, aren’t we?”</p>
<p>“Indeed we are, Ernie dear,” I returned. And
then we had to hurry, since it was already late.</p>
<p>“See, there are Aunt Adelaide and Meta,” I
cried, presently, as we neared the church porch.
“They are going in just ahead of us. How stunningly
they are gotten up! Meta’s suit is charming,
and what a love of a hat!”</p>
<p>“But we look nice, too,” returned Ernie, with
an irrepressible little skip, and a downward glance
at the bright flower in her button-hole. “We
can’t help it, Elizabeth,—because, we are <i>so
glad</i>!”</p>
<p>The swelling notes of the organ, the youthful,
soaring voices of the choristers, in exultant anthem
and hymn, the collect, and short, strong
sermon, seemed all a wonderful expression of our
own inward thanksgiving and gratitude. Never
before has an Easter service meant so much
to me, and I know it was the same with
Ernie.</p>
<p>Our shabby gloves met in sympathetic clasp.
We squeezed one another’s hands, and thought of
that other morning when we sat side by side on
the dark attic stairs, waiting for news of Robin.
Oh, to have made up one’s mind to renunciation,
only to have one’s treasure given back double-fold!
For we have great hopes of Bobsie now;
Dr. Porter is more than satisfied with the progress
he is making; and only listen,—there’s more good
news to tell!</p>
<p>For after service Aunt Adelaide and Meta
waited for us in the church-porch, and we walked
a couple of blocks together.</p>
<p>“Geof is very anxious to see you, Ernie,” said
Aunt Adelaide. “Can you manage to get around
for a little visit this afternoon? Dr. Porter has
given his permission.”</p>
<p>“Oh!” cried Ernie, with an ecstatic little
prance. “May I truly come? That’s the one
thing needed to make the day perfect!”</p>
<p>“Ask your mamma to come with you,” smiled
Aunt Adelaide;—for the old breach seems really
healed at last. Our mutual anxiety over Geof
and Robin has brought us closer together
than anything else could ever have done.
“Tell her please that there is a little matter
Uncle George and I want to talk over with
her.”</p>
<p>“Yes; certainly I will,” returned Ernie; while
Meta asked, with a glance at the posy in my button-hole:</p>
<p>“Did Robin get many flowers for Easter?”</p>
<p>“Indeed he did,” I returned; “a pot of pansies,
a lily, a purple hyacinth, and a beautiful crimson
rambler. It is one mass of bloom. It came just
before church, and there was no card, so we have
been guessing ever since.”</p>
<p>Meta nodded her head in a satisfied way. “He
and Geof ought to have something pretty,” she
said. “They have been sick so long, and it must
be horrid to lie in bed with nothing but the wallpaper
to look at. I think it’s rather nice to send
Easter cards with Easter flowers, instead of your
name, don’t you?”</p>
<p>Then we separated, and I thought no more of
Meta’s remark; but this afternoon when Ernie
stole on tiptoe into Geof’s room, the first thing
she noticed, after the patient, of course, was a
second crimson rambler rose, the exact duplicate
of Robin’s.</p>
<p>“Where did it come from, Geof?” asked Ernie,
hoping to clear up the mystery of Bobsie’s plant.
“Was there any card?”</p>
<p>“Why, no,” answered Geof. His poor hands
were those of a skeleton; his voice was a whisper;
his eyes seemed the only living thing left. When
Ernie looked at him, she wanted to kiss him and
cry;—but that would not have been cheering, so
she asked about the crimson rambler, instead.</p>
<p>“It came this morning, just before church.
Meta brought it up. There wasn’t any visiting
card, but there was this Easter affair with the
moulting angel. I told Meta he’d make a big
mistake if he tried to fly with <i>those</i> wings; and
she didn’t seem to like it much, though she said,
‘I was undoubtedly an authority on the subject!’
It’s the first <i>natural</i> remark she’s made to me
since I’ve been sick,” added Geof, with a weak
little chuckle. “I,—I rather think I liked it.”</p>
<p>“Well,” says Ernie, in a burst of really unusual
perspicacity, “I don’t wonder Meta didn’t enjoy
your criticism! I’m willing to bet my hat (it’s
the old one with the frozen pompon, you know)
that she alone is responsible for the angel and the
rose, too. Robin received duplicates this morning,
just about the same time; only his angel has
a drum instead of a trumpet, and from something
Meta said to Elizabeth I am almost sure that she
chose them!”</p>
<p>Geof’s pale cheeks flushed and he lay quiet for
a moment. “I never suspected it,” he said, at
last; “but I guess perhaps you’re right. Certainly
Meta has been treating me pretty white, lately,
and the mater, too. I,—I wouldn’t wonder a
bit, Bunnie, if things were going to be different.”</p>
<p>Meantime mother, Aunt Adelaide, and Uncle
George were holding an equally interesting conversation
in the library downstairs.</p>
<p>It seems that Dr. Porter wants Geof to go
away for a couple of weeks; and he also remarked,
in an apparently casual aside (though
we are tempted to suspect it was premeditated),
that a change would be an excellent thing for
Robin; but that he did not feel at liberty to prescribe
it when he thought of the heavy expenses
we had been under for the operation. The two
remarks worked together in Aunt Adelaide’s
mind,—as perhaps they were intended to do,—and
the result is that she has asked mother to take
Geof and Robin, too, to Atlantic City for a fortnight,
with Maria to help care for them, and
Uncle George to foot the bills. And mother did
not hesitate to accept, since Aunt Adelaide stated
quite frankly that the obligation will be mutual.
She does not want to leave the city just at present,
and she quite shrinks from the responsibility
of overseeing Geoffrey’s convalescence. Could
anything be more splendid!</p>
<p>Just think of our dear little Bobsie enjoying a
holiday by the sea!—growing fat and rosy playing
about on the beach, picking up clam-shells,
and——</p>
<p>But that reminds me. I must interrupt my
jubilations to tell of the sad end of Abraham Lincoln!
Ernie and I have suspected for a couple
of days past that all was not well in the little glass
globe. Since Thursday, A. L. has refused to
snatch at a straw, no matter how persistently he
has been “tickled.” Yesterday “he opened his
mouth,” as Bobsie explained, and he has not
closed it since;—till, this afternoon, when I was
talking to Robin about his little red prayer-book,—which
I had just rescued from forming a tent
for one of the white mice,—my olfactory organ
began to misgive me.</p>
<p>“It isn’t like your other books, Bobsie dear,”
I was explaining. “You must never use it to
play with, or be careless of it. You may keep it
under your pillow with your handkerchief, if you
want; and when you are older and can understand
better, you will find it full of the most comfortable
words. Whatever your sorrow, you
will always find something to help. But, bless
me! What a smell! Where <i>does</i> it come
from?”</p>
<p>“Abraham Lincoln,” answered Robin, in
solemn accents.</p>
<p>“So it does!” I returned, sniffing suspiciously
into the little globe. “This will never do, Bobs.
He’s stark dead, child! I must take it down and
throw it into the back-yard.”</p>
<p>“You <i>shan’t</i>!” howled Bobsie, in a sudden outburst
of uncontrollable woe. “I ’spected maybe
he was sick; so I gave him some of my medicine
and a teaspoonful of beef tea! You mustn’t
throw him into the back-yard, Elizabeth! He’s
been too <i>good</i>, I tell you!”</p>
<p>“But what is to be done about it then, dear?”
I asked; for such violence of anguish was unusual
on the part of Robin. “We can’t keep him here
any longer. You can see that for yourself.”</p>
<p>“Then let’s have a nice little funeral,” sniffed
Robin, pathetically. “We’ll b-bury him beneath
the crimson bramble rose, and you can read some
of the com-comfortable words out of my little
red prayer-book.”</p>
<p>“But, Bobsie,” I remonstrated; “prayer-books
weren’t written about <i>clams</i>! I don’t think there
is anything here.”</p>
<p>“You said I would always f-find something
to c-comfort me,” sobbed Bobsie. “And now,
when I need it most,—you won’t even look!”</p>
<p>What was to be done? Robin’s faith was
really touching. I could not bear to disappoint
him, if it could be helped.</p>
<p>“Well, honey,” I said, at last, “don’t cry any
more. We will bury Abraham Lincoln under the
crimson bramble rose. Come,—you shall dig the
grave with this silver teaspoon, and then if there
is anything about clams in the prayer-book, I’ll
read it to you.”</p>
<p>So Abraham Lincoln was neatly interred; and
as Robin patted down the earth with the bowl of
his silver spoon, I began in a grave voice from
the Benedicite:</p>
<p>“O ye Whales, and all that move in the waters,
bless ye the Lord: praise Him, and magnify Him
for ever.”</p>
<p>It was the best I could do, after a vain flutter
of pages, and though a clam isn’t exactly the same
as a whale, Robin was more than satisfied.</p>
<p>“What did I tell you?” he asked. “I knew
there’d be something if only you would look!
And I s’pose Abraham Lincoln <i>moved</i>, Elizabeth,
when he came from the fishman’s at Christmas
to this little globe.”</p>
<p>Later, when I told Ernie of the tragedy, she
took it almost as seriously as Robin. “Of course
we had to expect that he would die sometime,”
she admitted, with a little sigh. “And I’m glad
he waited till we had the crimson rambler under
which to bury him. It must have been a great
comfort to Bobsie! Abraham Lincoln was always
such a <i>tactful clam</i>!”</p>
</div>

<div class='rb-container'><div class='rb'>
<h2 class='mt2em mb1em fs1r0em chapter'>Saturday, April 18.</h2>
</div></div>
<p class='ti0'>The most wonderful thing has happened. I
shall be able to fill the last two pages of my
diary with such news,—and all because Ernie and
I determined to clean house!</p>
<p>“It’s absurd to miss them so,” said Ernie, as
she set Bobsie’s books straight in the nursery
book-shelf yesterday afternoon. “But, somehow,
I can’t get used to seeing this room so tidy!”</p>
<p>“And how queer it is not having any trays to
carry,” I answered. “Mother and Bobs have
never been away from us before. I wonder if
there will be another letter this evening.”</p>
<p>“Mother writes such lovely letters, and Geof’s
postscripts are so funny,” chuckled Ernie, with a
slap at the front of her sailor blouse, where the
last family epistle reposed. “Fancy Robin refusing
clam-fritters, and telling the head waiter
all about Abraham Lincoln in the hotel dining-room!”</p>
<p>“Well, I shall be glad when they are home
again,” I admitted. “Perhaps that sounds selfish,
since the change is doing them so much good;
but I can’t help feeling lonely when you are at
school, dear.”</p>
<p>“Elizabeth, don’t you think it would be nice to
have a little surprise for mother?” asked Ernestine.
“Something useful that would save her
work or trouble, after she comes back? I’ll tell
you what,—suppose we clean house! You, and
Rose, and I could do it perfectly well; and this
place hasn’t had a good raking out in ages!”</p>
<p>“That’s rather a sensible idea,” I agreed; “especially
now, when the family is so small. We
could manage the attic, the basement, and the
parlour floor, perhaps; but we mustn’t disturb the
boarders. Have you noticed, Ernie, that the
Lysles have been receiving summer resort pamphlets
in almost every mail this week? I am
afraid it means they are planning to leave the city
early,—and Miss Brown told me Monday that
she had an invitation to spend July and August
with her nieces in the Adirondacks. I try not to
worry; but we have drawn our last money from
the bank, and, oh, I do dread the summer!”</p>
<p>“Don’t think about it, then,” returned Ernie,
stoutly. “We’ve weathered a good many storms,
honey, and it would be pretty ungrateful for us to
fret <i>now</i>. Perhaps something will turn up at the
last moment. I wish we were going to the country,
too!” she added, with an inconsistent little
sigh.</p>
<p>“Robin has never seen a clover field,” I answered,
“nor a live cow. And I haven’t tasted
buttermilk since I was seven years old. Just
think, the woods are full of violets this very minute,—and
thrushes, and bluebirds!”</p>
<p>“I know it,” returned Ernie, glancing pensively
out the window at the battered row of ash-cans
that lined our dusty street. “I wish we could
rent this old house,” she added, vindictively, “and
go away, and start a chicken farm! I’m tired of
boarders, Elizabeth;—even when they are as kind
and considerate as Miss Brown and the Hippo
family!”</p>
<p>“You can’t be as tired of them as I am,” I
answered,—“because you don’t have to order
their meals! But we would need the front stoop
browned over, and the cellar concreted, before we
could dream of letting; and such things cost
money. It just seems as if our hands were tied.”</p>
<p>“Which needn’t prevent them from wielding a
broom!” exclaimed Ernie, springing up with an
energetic shake of her short skirts. “Come on,
child,—I’m ashamed of us! A little hard work
is the medicine we need. The idea of sitting
here in opposite rocking-chairs, croakin’ at one
another like a pair of discontented grannies, when
Robin and Geof are growing fat in Atlantic City,
and mother is having a really truly holiday for
the first time in years! <i>I’m</i> going up to begin
on the attic this instant; and if we have to feel
blue in June,—why, that’s nearly two months off,
yet.”</p>
<p>“But it’s four o’clock, Ernie,” I protested.
“Don’t you think we had better put off the house-cleaning
till to-morrow?”</p>
<p>“No, I don’t,” returned Ernie, impetuously.
“There is a pile of magazines in the workshop
that hasn’t been looked over since the year 1,
Tecpatl! Mother told me weeks ago that she
wanted them sent to the Philippines. She asked
me to go through them then. So, come on.”</p>
<p>“Very well,” I answered, meekly. And a few
moments later Ernie and I were seated on the
workshop floor, each with our separate bunch of
dusty literature.</p>
<p>“Here’s that nice story about the rogue elephant,”
began Ernie, comfortably. “I don’t
think we can let that go. And, oh! here’s the
copy of <i>Scribbler’s</i> with <i>The Magic Ring</i>. Do
you remember, we read it aloud one Christmas?
It is about the two little boys who went to the
Circus.”</p>
<p>“I thought,” returned I, severely, “that we
came up here to get these magazines ready to
send to the Philippines?”</p>
<p>“So we did,” mumbled Ernie, “but if we don’t
go through them, how are we to know which
ones we ought to send?”</p>
<p>At that moment I came upon an odd instalment
of <i>The Refugees</i>, a thrilling historical
romance that had haunted my memory for years.
“Of course,” I agreed, with suspicious alacrity;
and after that we sat together on the workshop
floor, and read and read; till the shadows began
to steal out from the corners, the room grew dusk
and gloomy, and I looked up with straining eyes
to remark,—</p>
<p>“Ernestine, it is simply provoking! Why will
editors always break off at the most exciting
spot? The Indians are attacking the blockhouse,
I can’t find the next instalment, and——”</p>
<p>“<i>Whoop-ee!</i>” rang the shrill war-cry. “<i>Whoop!
Whoop! hurrah! hur-roo-o</i>!”</p>
<p>For a moment I glared about me in terror.
Was I in the workshop or the Canadian backwoods?
Was the wildly whirling figure that
pranced and capered about me, now advancing,
now retreating, my own little sister Ernie, or a
bloodthirsty Iroquois savage?</p>
<p>“I’ve found it! I’ve found it!” shrilled the
jubilant song. “After all my hunts, Elizabeth!
In the cuckoo-clock, under Hazard’s bed!—And
to think we <i>nearly</i> sent it to Manila!”</p>
<p>“What are you talking about, Ernestine?” I
demanded, severely. “No matter what you have
found, you ought to be ashamed to shout so!
You know that Miss Brown has a headache, and
besides I quite mistook you for an Indian!”</p>
<p>Ernie dropped down beside me, and flung her
arms about my neck. “Honey,” she breathed,—“it’s
the <i>contract</i>,—the Dump-Cart Contract, at
last! Stuck between the pages of an old copy
of <i>Cayler’s Engineering Magazine</i>! And to
think, we almost sent it <i>to Manila</i>!”</p>
<p>So! I understood. The room began to swim
about me. My head sank limply to Ernie’s supporting
shoulder.</p>
<div id='i308' class='figcenter id05'>
  <img src='images/illus-308.jpg' style='width:100%;' alt='' />
  <div class='caption fs90p'>
    I stood in the kitchen doorway and listened
  </div>
</div>
<p>“Don’t you dare go and faint on me!” threatened
that unsympathetic young person. “If you
do, I’ll spill water over your new rosebud stock.
I mean it, Elizabeth!”</p>
<p>“You shan’t!” I retorted; and sat up, clutching
my precious embroidered collar with one
hand, while I extended the other for the contract.</p>
<p>Ernie picked up the yellow-backed magazine,
which she had dropped in the window when she
began her wild war-dance, and extracted a legal-looking
document.</p>
<p>“Here it is,” she said; “and it was by the
merest chance I found it. I knew there would be
nothing in <i>Cayler’s</i> to interest us, though some
stray engineer in Manila might like it. And I
was just about to put it with these other magazines
we don’t want,—when I noticed the date,
and that made me think of dear father. So I
opened it, just to see what he had been reading,
and the first thing I came on was the contract!
Oh, Elizabeth, he must have slipped it in here on
his way home from Mr. Perry’s office that very
afternoon! How natural it seems! And Rose
cleared it away later, and we never suspected!
<i>Well!</i>”</p>
<p>By this time Ernie and I were reading the document
through, our heads close together in the
window, our hearts thumping. Despite the legal
verbiage which we did not altogether understand,
despite the fast-fading light, there could be no
doubt. The Dump-Cart Contract was found! It
was also dated, witnessed, and signed, with a pathetic
little blot of ink under the dear familiar G
stem in father’s name.</p>
<p>At first we could hardly believe our good fortune!</p>
<p>“Five per cent. of whatever profits the invention
is making,” gasped Ernie,—“and perhaps
some back money, too! Oh, Elizabeth, the boarders
can leave whenever they like, now! The
quicker the better—We can shut up this house,
and go away to the country. Robin shall play in
the clover fields, you shall drink buttermilk, and
<i>I</i> will start a chicken farm! What a lovely surprise
for mother!”</p>
<p>And she threw her arms about my neck, and
for a while we wept and laughed together.</p>
<p>“And to think how ungrateful we were this
very afternoon! It makes one rather ashamed
doesn’t it, dear?” I concluded, with a penitent
sniff. “Haze and I will go and see Uncle George
this evening. He will advise us.”</p>
<p>“About what?” asked Hazard’s voice, with a
worried little accent, from the attic stairs. “Has
anything happened? Is there bad news from
mother?”</p>
<p>“No, indeed,” we answered. “Come in.
Light the gas. We’ve something to show you.”</p>
<p>So Hazard came. Ernie struck a match, and
again in the dear, familiar workshop, where so
many important councils have been held, so many
family problems settled, we read the contract
through together.</p>
<p>“Well,” says Haze, with a little sigh. “So it
is really found! What a scamp that Perry is!
Yes, Elizabeth, you and I will see Uncle George
this evening.”</p>
<p>“I’m coming, too,” piped Ernie. “I found it!
I want to see what he will say!”</p>
<p>So after dinner,—where it was rather trying,
I can tell you, to talk and eat as if nothing had
happened because we did not think it wise for the
boarders to suspect till things should be a little
more definitely settled,—we slipped into our hats
and jackets and hurried around to Uncle
George’s.</p>
<p>He sat at his desk in the library with a number
of papers before him, and he looked up, rather
surprised and displeased, as William ushered us
into the room.</p>
<p>“Anything wrong at home?” he began. “You
are not in trouble again, I hope, Hazard?”</p>
<p>“No, sir,” says Haze, importantly. “Not this
time, thanks.” And he handed Uncle George the
contract.</p>
<p>Well, you just ought to have seen Uncle
George’s face change as he read it.</p>
<p>“Where did this come from?” he asked,
abruptly. “Who found it? when?”</p>
<p>“I did,” piped Ernie; “this afternoon in an old
copy of <i>Cayler’s Engineering Magazine</i>. And,
oh, Uncle George, it was the narrowest escape!
We nearly sent it to Manila, to the sick soldiers!”</p>
<p>“H-m-m!” says Uncle George, surveying the
signatures again. “You are to be congratulated,
young lady.” And then he added in a lower
tone, as if to himself:—“I’ve done poor Dudley a
great injustice. Apparently he wasn’t altogether
a fool.” And, turning to Haze, he continued,
“I’ll keep this paper, my boy, and look out for
your interests. Undoubtedly you have all been
very badly treated. With the contract here to
prove it, we could prosecute Perry, and perhaps
even land him behind the bars, but that would be
a rather poor satisfaction, after all, and if you
follow my advice you will use your power to settle
things as expeditiously and as much to your
advantage as possible.”</p>
<p>“Oh, yes!” answered Ernie, Haze, and I, together.
“We don’t want to put anybody in jail.
All we want is a little money.”</p>
<p>“Well,” returned Uncle George, “I’ll do my
best to get it for you.” And then he took us into
the drawing-room, and we related the story again
to Meta and Aunt Adelaide, who listened with
all their ears.</p>
<p>“How perfectly dandy!” cried Meta, clapping
her hands when the last explanation had been
made, and the last question answered. “Oh, I
am so <i>glad</i>, and I guess you are, too, Elizabeth,—even
if you didn’t mind being poor!”</p>
<p>“Indeed I am,” I agreed. “And I never said
I didn’t <i>mind</i>, Meta;—only that there were certain
advantages which one had to experience to
find out.”</p>
<p>And then Aunt Adelaide rang the bell, and
ordered seltzer lemonade and strawberry shortcake,
and we feasted and planned. And later we
came home and planned some more, after writing
the good news to mother; till now it is nearly
twelve o’clock, and I am sitting at my desk pouring
out the wonderful story afresh, while Ernie
lolls on the side of the bed, and maunders
drowsily:—</p>
<p>“I think I’ll try Cochin Chinas, unless they’re
the kind that wear ruffly pantalets. Did you ever
hear of the lady that started with one egg, and
ended with fifty thousand dollars? Oh, do
come to bed, Elizabeth, or it will never be to-morrow
morning. Our luck has changed!—and
we want to wake up and find that we haven’t
dreamed it.”</p>
<p>What Ernie says is true. Our luck has
changed, indeed! And yet,—what is luck? I
like to remember something the kind “Hippopotamus”
said to mother one evening this winter
when Robin was very sick, when Rose seemed
extra-incompetent, when we were all feeling
blue.</p>
<p>“Mrs. Graham,” he remarked, “you’re a lucky
woman. I don’t care how vexatious things may
seem, I don’t care how unfortunate:—with four
such children as you have, there’s bound to be
luck in a house!”</p>
<p>Wasn’t it pretty of him? And now that the
Dump-Cart Contract is found, now that we are
poor no longer, it will be good to remember that,
for better or worse, we, ourselves, must always be
the <i>real</i> luck of the Dudley Grahams.</p>

electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.</p>

<h3>Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm</h3>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.</p>

<p>Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org.</p>

<h3>Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation</h3>

501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by

<h3>Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation</h3>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.</p>

<p>The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/donate">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.</p>

<p>While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.</p>

<p>International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.</p>

<p>Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate</p>

<h3>Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.</h3>

<p>Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.</p>

<p>Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org</p>

<p>This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.</p>
